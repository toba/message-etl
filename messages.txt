	9:47 PM	Jessica:	Do you ever have those moments where somebody is so mind shatteringly selfish and horrible that it may take you a few days to even  put the right words together, because it is so unfathomable for most of the population to be that way?? Yet they think they are logical and normal?? Even though everybody around them has to put effort into tolerating being around them??? No matter what damage they cause in their wake they will NEVER change anything or say they are sorry???

Thursday, February 24, 2011

	12:36 PM	Jason:	We are at McDonalds
	12:36 PM	Jason:	Cozy up there?
	12:39 PM	Jessica:	Yes. It was actually to hot on lower floor because so crowded. Moved up a floor. Have my tablet,  notebook, tea, salad and large table :)

	12:40 PM	Jason:	Lodge
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	Yea. I got lucky getting a parking spot as someone was leaving or it would have been a walk
	12:41 PM	Jason:	We had to take the shuttle last week
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	There was a bad accident on the way up. Vehicle over embankment. Didn’t look good
	12:43 PM	Jason:	Driver died. Drive safe.
	12:45 PM	Jessica:	We figured. We were by the ambulance went it left. Light’s were on but no hurry. After seeing where it went off I would have been surprised if nobody died. Roads not bad though
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	Wifi would be very helpful

	2:28 PM	Jason:	Yea

	2:30 PM	Jessica:	Lucky you. Test her letter skills. 
	2:54 PM	Jessica:	You should set up the go pro on Hunter’s helmet. 
	3:37 PM	Jason:	That would be cool. He still boarding?
	3:39 PM	Jessica:	Yep. He is to check in at 4
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	Stuck again on the way down. I think it’s the same one. We just came across on the way up as it had just happened so got through quicker.  They are probably clearing wreckage now
	5:32 PM	Jessica:	Maybe new one. We came back up told closer two 2 hours before being able to get past. 
	5:33 PM	Jason:	Two hours! Do you have to wait in the jeep or can you go back to the lodge?
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	We went back to the lower lodge. I had to pee, tea gone! Hunter took off to board more.
	5:37 PM	Jessica:	Phone will die soon. I will have him text on our way down when it is plugged in
	5:52 PM	Jessica:	Any info on the news?

	7:08 PM	Jason:	Okay, just learned about the math assignment. He was telling me everything was done.
	7:15 PM	Jason:	He’s working on the assignment. Had you made a deal with him after coming home late on the bike about getting TV back before the weekend? He thinks so.
	7:45 PM	Jessica:	 Have him  do his homework. I will deal with the rest. Sorry I left
	7:48 PM	Jason:	No worries. Just trying to hold him to whatever you’d told him. We’re fine here. :-)

	12:33 PM	Jason:	Heather was worried. Sounds like you’re running late. Home at 9 or 10?
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	In woodland now. She is being annoying
	1:34 PM	Jason:	Okay. I don’t know why she was worried. I guess just expecting a departure message. Good driving so far?

Monday, August 18, 2014

	10:21 AM	Jason:	just checking in while walking for my second TB shot. a couple craigslist inquiries but no lookers yet.
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	I am going to get a hot yoga card today and get a class in so I may be out. I will let you know which one in case of Craigslist inquiries.  I copied you on the email to Mark, he responded so that is no longer an issue. 
	10:30 AM	Jason:	yoga will be good. i think any lookers can be scheduled after i’m home so no worries about that.
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	Okay.  I am going to an event at 6:30 so need to leave here about 6:15

Tuesday, August 19, 2014

	9:04 AM	Jason:	Don’t reply if you’re still sleeping. A guy wants to stop and pick up that old black, kids bike. Just wanted to give him a time.
	9:32 AM	Jessica:	I need to go with Kayla to her 10am appt for her iud. Should be back around 11. I would tell him 11:30 to be safe
	9:32 AM	Jason:	Will do.

	1:13 PM	Jessica:	In the shop? 
	1:15 PM	Jason:	Oh yeah its locked
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	I’ll just take Brenna swimming soon then after dinner w can take it to Heathers. Then you can see the new place
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	I meant we. Hunter hasn’t seen it yet either
	1:17 PM	Jason:	Sounds good

Thursday, August 21, 2014

	8:12 AM	Jason:	Just have a 2:00 - 3:00 meeting today so might be easier to go before?
	8:18 AM	Jessica:	Sure.  I can do a late lunch with Cyndi and 4 pm hot yoga
	8:23 AM	Jessica:	Reschedule with Cyndi so all good. What time so I can call hunter to get home
	8:24 AM	Jason:	What do you think? 10:00 or 10:30?
	8:25 AM	Jessica:	That works. I week tell him to be here by 10
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	Only t the livestock gates are open before noon. The rest not until then
	10:00 AM	Jason:	You’re saying the rides aren’t open before noon?
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	Yep
	10:03 AM	Jason:	With my 2:00, that would only give about 1½ hours, which may be plenty. Or we can go after 3:00.
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Your call
	10:07 AM	Jason:	I like earlier but I can’t remember how much time we usually spend there
	10:08 AM	Jessica:	Usually longer. We have two kids going on different rides most likely
	10:09 AM	Jason:	In 2006 we spent a little under two hours there with Kayla and Hunter going on rides
	10:10 AM	Jason:	Let’s go after, then, so it’s not a worry.
	10:12 AM	Jessica:	Okay
	10:13 AM	Jason:	Too bad, I was hoping for a corndog lunch
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	We can make it happen if you want
	10:21 AM	Jason:	Nah, it’s no fun to be watching the clock while trying to have fun. 
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	True.  Well since we changed lunch hot yoga at 12:15 for me!
	10:23 AM	Jason:	git 'er done :-)
	10:43 AM	Jason:	I’ll probably be at a conference 9/8-10
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	Well I guess we’ll eventually see each other. Maybe in October. 
	10:45 AM	Jason:	:-(  It will be in Vegas. You should come.
	10:58 AM	Jessica:	At least you get a fun conference place! 
	12:08 PM	Jason:	out costco account is still expired, right? was thinking of some big prints to put on the walls
	12:09 PM	Jessica:	Yes. I use Heathers
	12:09 PM	Jessica:	I think I have her card stored in there
	12:10 PM	Jessica:	Into the heat I go
	12:10 PM	Jason:	Oh, don’t you have to show the card, though?
	12:10 PM	Jason:	Be strong!
	12:12 PM	Jason:	There are tiny birds on my window sill
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Yes when you pay.  If you order I can pick up with her. Kayla needs her face wash before she leaves from there
	1:22 PM	Jason:	Okay. Good exercise?
	1:27 PM	Jessica:	Must puke
	1:27 PM	Jason:	That would be a yes.
	1:41 PM	Jessica:	 Yes. Sounds like you need a bird feeder
	3:35 PM	Jason:	Sorry, Jason had me in his office. Heading home now.
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	Okay

Wednesday, August 27, 2014

	8:19 AM	Jason:	HealthSave plan is $2200/year cheaper for us than PPO
	8:20 AM	Jason:	But HealthSave has $3000 deductible instead of $1400
	8:23 AM	Jason:	And HealthSave pays zero on Rx until deductible is met so those would be pull price for a while
	8:24 AM	Jason:	Full price PPO is about $500/month but presumably we’d get HealthU discounts
	8:29 AM	Jason:	Joyce talked to me and now I forgot where I was. But leaning toward the more expensive, better coverage. Thoughts?
	8:34 AM	Jessica:	I am fine with your choice.  What I would take into account is that this year kayla is gone and covered medically through the insurance purchased with rotary.  Hunter is also covered by Scott and I do his prescription through that plan
	8:35 AM	Jessica:	The healthU discounts are usually on the deductible as well. Not the monthly cost. 
	8:37 AM	Jason:	Okay. Are there kids we DO NOT need dental/ortho for?
	8:39 AM	Jason:	Same question for vision ... cost doesn’t change but is it more complex to have double coverage?
	8:40 AM	Jason:	Same question for vision ... cost doesn’t change but is it more complex to have double coverage?
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Because hunter is going to need braces most likely I think we want the double for him
	8:40 AM	Jason:	And I think decline flexible spending. Those and HSA always seem more hassle than their worth. Agree?
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Nobody else has other
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Agreed
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	So nauseous.  In the back and her driving is like being at sea in a storm
	8:42 AM	Jason:	Ugh. :-)
	8:43 AM	Jason:	Total monthly is $597 without HealthyU discounts
	8:45 AM	Jessica:	Okay
	8:49 AM	Jason:	All signed up, effective 9/1. Love you ...
	8:55 AM	Jason:	How was Kayla when you rang her? I’ll do my best to put her at ease. Dote on her. That kind of thing.
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	Love you too. Good job! 
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	She messaged before I called so haven’t talked to her yet
	8:56 AM	Jason:	Ah. Hopefully brenna was not being a turkey. She was made i wouldn’t let her have an ice cream sandwich.
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	Of course.  That girl does not take no for an answer
	9:29 AM	Jason:	Eh. Pamela outside my office is wearing perfume. I need that tobacco candle.
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	Oh no
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	Here. Cleaning up to go to registration and session
	5:24 PM	Jessica:	At team dinner so very loud to talk
	9:23 PM	Jessica:	Charging my phone. It’s been dead. 

Thursday, August 28, 2014

	8:07 AM	Jason:	Awake yet? :-)
	8:11 AM	Jessica:	Showered, hair and makeup
	8:22 AM	Jason:	A bunch of hot air balloons were drifting near our house this morning. Must be the way of the wind today.
	8:29 AM	Jessica:	The glow thing is happening
	8:31 AM	Jason:	Why is there nobody in this conference room with me?
	8:35 AM	Jessica:	Bwahaha! 
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	When you have a second take the add off of Craigslist. 
	12:05 PM	Jason:	Ad is removed
	12:12 PM	Jason:	Our American Window payment didn’t get made. Is that manual? I thought it was automatic.
	1:19 PM	Jason:	I used my phone for the first time. Pretty exciting.
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	Thank you.  Yes it is supposed to be. Woohooo!  You’re all professional and stuff now; )
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	My feet HURT
	1:57 PM	Jason:	Meetings, meetings. I’ll rub your feet later.

Friday, September 5, 2014

	10:02 AM	Jessica:	I’m in a meeting.
	10:02 AM	Jason:	Phone said you called
	2:27 PM	Jason:	Want to go see Lucy tonight at Edwards 21? Then we should have an outing on the weekend to take advantage of the nice weather.
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	Sounds good. Kayla is about to get 6 shots.....
	2:29 PM	Jason:	Oh yea. She needs Brenna to tell her shots don’t hurt.
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	She didn’t cry:) what movie time are you thinking? 
	4:32 PM	Jason:	7:55 at E21
	4:32 PM	Jessica:	It’s a date
	4:38 PM	Jessica:	So make dinner then? 
	4:39 PM	Jason:	I’m kind of full of peanuts. We could eat somewhere. Whatever your preference is works for me. As always.
	4:41 PM	Jessica:	Well kayla just had chili, Brenna is still working on her lunch and your full of nuts( or just nutty) so I won’t make dinner right now then since nobody will eat it.

Monday, September 8, 2014

	5:10 PM	Jessica:	I miss you
	6:24 PM	Jason:	Ditto. Kristin Armstrong is in the seat in front of me.
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	Funny!  I doubt she remembers you taking pictures of her. She probably does that a lot. 
	6:32 PM	Jason:	I’m sure not. Just now explaining.
	6:32 PM	Jessica:	:)
	9:43 PM	Jason:	Hey, I typed deplaning earlier. Dinner now.
	9:57 PM	Jessica:	Have a good dinner. We miss you. 

Tuesday, September 9, 2014

	12:04 PM	Jason:	Ack, reconnected to SLHS network and now can’t do hangouts anymore. Still got plain text.
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	Learning lots? 
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Sending you a e-mail to dl a big file for me.
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	Directory listing

Thursday, September 11, 2014

	2:07 PM	Jason:	Shooting to leave in about 30
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	I will be on the couch snuggling the sickie

Monday, September 15, 2014

	4:01 PM	Jason:	Reservations tonight? Running like crazy?
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	Yep . Total craziness. At the Dr now. Working with insurance on the prescriptions.  6am reservation
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	Pm
	4:08 PM	Jason:	Sounds fun. One more Dr. thing to check tomorrow is the bill for the Freeman dentist with Brenna. It’s gone to collections. I didn’t know any was overdue.
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	Me either. They had billed it all wrong and they couldn’t seem to do it correctly so bauter office sent them the info and I thought it was taken care of
	4:12 PM	Jason:	$274 is due. Sound familiar?
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	No. The original bill was over 500
	4:14 PM	Jason:	So maybe that’s just what’s left. Too bad medical billing can’t be better so my credit score doesn’t have to drop with all the collections.
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Agreed.  Dealing with medical is my ongoing nightmare. In the office now. 
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	Of course she has no fever at the moment
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	And yes,  she has pneumonia
	4:56 PM	Jason:	Sheesh. I didn’t think that was contagious. What’s the treatment this time?
	5:01 PM	Jessica:	Switching to the zithromax . It isn’t bad, her being on the amoxicillan kept it from blowing up like Kayla’s but is a bit drug resistant considering
	5:50 PM	Jessica:	Finishing up at the pharmacy. Getting her flu shot 
	5:50 PM	Jason:	We’re ready here, I think
	5:51 PM	Jessica:	Okay I moved it to 6:15

Tuesday, September 16, 2014

	12:00 PM	Jason:	How are Kayla’s travels going?
	12:05 PM	Jessica:	She’s on her way to Dallas
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	Brenna wasn’t happy about going to school,  but I think she will be fine once she gets playing with her friends. They were really excited to see her
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	In meetings? 

Thursday, September 18, 2014

	12:47 PM	Jason:	I might need a bagel
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	In a blue sky mood?
	1:55 PM	Jason:	Are you home the rest of the day other than getting Brenna? A guy wants to look at the bicycle.
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	3:19 PM	Jason:	I’m coming down off my cookie high
	3:29 PM	Jessica:	Hahaha. I got to Skype with Kayla:)
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	We should also putthe elliptical on Craigslist now that I am back to hot yoga
	5:21 PM	Jason:	Meetings keep running long. Ergh.

Friday, September 19, 2014

	12:55 PM	Jason:	Did I leave my lunch on the counter?
	1:30 PM	Jason:	Weird, lunch isn’t in my car either. Maybe splattered on the road somewhere. :-(
	3:05 PM	Jessica:	It was on the washing machine
	3:39 PM	Jessica:	Messaging working again!  That was like not being able to talk:(
	4:39 PM	Jason:	Some people in meetings are talkative.
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	You may be there awhile then 

Monday, September 22, 2014

	2:56 PM	Jason:	Close?
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	Here
	2:57 PM	Jason:	Where?

	4:44 PM	Jessica:	Ugh, I have to be careful who I let have my card at certain networking events...emails and phone calls galore, though I know they are trying to get me to promote them or sell me something. It’s really irritating.

	10:22 AM	Jason:	Its all yours

	10:49 AM	Jason:	she has so much stress in her life (just finished meeting)
	10:51 AM	Jessica:	Ypu 8am ;) Yeah, rough life for her. She was very specific about her lunch today as well. Turkey slices, cheese cubes, carrots, raspberries and pomegranate seeds and DON”T FORGET MY PICKLE!!
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	Hitting the one hour hot yoga today to see how I do. I think I would like to start the 6am one so I can be back by 7:30 am and shower with you before getting Brenna ready.
	10:52 AM	Jason:	wow
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	It will require kicking me in the ass and getting Hunter’s alarm clock working correctly since I won’t be able to get him up
	10:58 AM	Jason:	motivation!
	10:58 AM	Jason:	yes, i can kick
	10:59 AM	Jason:	i’m sure setting hunter’s clock won’t be that hard
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	maybe I should say nudge...
	11:02 AM	Jason:	:)
	1:40 PM	Jessica:	I am sweaty and naked. I also made Hunters counseling appt. Productive day.
	1:41 PM	Jason:	heh heh
	1:41 PM	Jason:	well done
	2:53 PM	Jessica:	and SHAVED!
	2:54 PM	Jason:	there’s nothing you can’t accomplish today
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	Muahahaha! Tomorrow i may even clean....another reason for wanting to knock out hot yoga early.
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	I am enjoying my high before Hunter gets home. Four more minutes.
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	okay, only one missing that was due today...we can do this
	3:00 PM	Jason:	go, fight, win
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	3:01 PM	Jason:	oh boy
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	Not feeling sick and having kids gone has me in a really good mood. I even stole the radio from Hunters room and blasted music in the shower and yes, there was singing.
	3:16 PM	Jason:	i’m glad that’s all it takes <3
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Hmm..no fighting, very quiet. I feel like I am in the twilight zone today.
	4:40 PM	Jason:	do not adjust your set
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	good point ;)
	4:40 PM	Jason:	we should watch some old twilight zone episodes
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	some of those were good
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	let me know when you leave so I can plan when to throw in the bisquets.

http://www.cdapress.com/news/local_news/article_37605b91-751d-5417-993b-3689c3ed1636.html
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	oh I like that last post. Very clear point. It reminds me of Doug’s justification of beating the crap out of us " It says in the bible whatever the parents say or do is correct and the bible clearly teaches that parents may physically discipline their children” obviously taken out of context, but still twisted to justify horrible behavior
	4:56 PM	Jason:	and http://www.cdapress.com/news/business/article_02ea848a-b8a8-5015-a020-4d0a8fbf2fcb.html
	4:57 PM	Jason:	the lord had a lot for me to say today
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	Oh, this is a new one
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	You must be feeling the holy spirit ;)
	4:59 PM	Jason:	but an old topic

	11:01 AM	Jessica:	I am irritated they automatically do an xray, sounds like that is the norm there..which is totally unnecessary, just a way to make money I think
	11:02 AM	Jason:	Ah, I see. I thought the rotary insurance would kick in.

	2:29 PM	Jason:	um, yes, my last meeting should be over at 10:30
	2:30 PM	Jason:	so i guess i should drive

	1:52 PM	Jessica:	Looks up your alley ;)
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Brenna is helping Hunter with his homework
	4:45 PM	Jason:	the most remarkable part of that observation is the helping not the homework
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	Right? Hunter is doing the drawing portion and has commissioned Brenna to do the coloring..which of course she is excited about so I am rolling with it. Just one day with out a battle would be awesome.

Thursday, November 20, 2014

	12:17 PM	Jason:	Yea!
	12:17 PM	Jessica:	Nasty
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	I may just set the house on fire rather than clean it
	12:45 PM	Jason:	that’s one way to do things
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	That way maybe it will stay clean for more than two hours
	1:02 PM	Jason:	looks nice out there. maybe i should come home early. let me know when the house is clean. ;)
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	not funny
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	yep just feeling a little buzzed on floor cleaner fumes

Monday, November 24, 2014

	12:40 PM	Jason:	Marcia had to reschedule her interview later so I probably can’t blow the sprinklers today but I’d like to try to do it before we leave tomorrow. Planning to work half-day tomorrow, if that works.
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	okay
	12:42 PM	Jason:	how are things with the kids?
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	Fine so far

	4:07 PM	Jason:	a bit after 5, it should be. was hoping more like 4 but haven’t seen marcia yet
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	not a good sign to be late
	4:08 PM	Jessica:	okay, Heather took the entire day so just now getting ready to head to Costco, debating whether to let Brenna stay or take her with. Backyard is done..my arms going to be sore tomorrow!
	4:11 PM	Jason:	ah, thanks so much for working with the boys on that. i can imagine having brenna along would be hectic but is it safe leaving her with the boys?
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	I am taking Colby to bring back to Heather. I think she will be good with a movie and Hunter is playing his game. Yes, it was much more productive to be out there with them or it would have been an all day thing if not two
	4:13 PM	Jason:	sounds good, i’ll be quick as i can getting home
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	If I take her I will message you
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	and when i leave so you know how long they are here unattended. I think it will be another 15 min or so
	4:19 PM	Jason:	ok
	4:43 PM	Jessica:	Leaving in a few, she is coming with me

	9:27 AM	Jessica:	at least no collision

	9:33 AM	Jessica:	I have a birthday dinner for Amanda at 6:30 tomorrow. I will go ahead and cancel the 3pm couples massage. At some point we need to have an actual plan to resolve things in some way. I am not doing this ignore everything and go about your business like everything is fine anymore. If you want to do it by email or chat, that’s fine as well. Maybe black and white responses are good so there is no more wrong perceptions and I don’t have to keep repeating the same thing over and over again
	9:35 AM	Jason:	i agree. i would rather talk. maybe this evening as the kids are playing.
	9:39 AM	Jessica:	I would prefer without kids around

	2:12 PM	Jason:	i could ask him to come by you house instead
	2:12 PM	Jason:	dammit, our house
	2:13 PM	Jessica:	It’s the key chain flask. Okay, just let me know as it gets closer and I will give her an eta
	2:14 PM	Jason:	do we want company in the family room? :) it’s actually easier to do it there. i don’t mind telling jeffery to meet me there. he has to come from meridian anyway
	2:16 PM	Jason:	oh, maybe he’s not coming personally, just sending the files. let me settle that first. :)
	2:19 PM	Jessica:	No problem. I will clean it up...which one is the family room?
	2:23 PM	Jason:	phbbt. that’s what i call the one where the computer is.

	3:04 PM	Jessica:	ummm, yeah confirmation is good. I can make sure things are clean now.... no guarantees on the weekend.
	3:06 PM	Jason:	not a big deal, really. just a guy from work. only thought kids underwear and such shouldn’t be piled on the couch. :)
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	okay, just your underwear or mine, got it

	4:46 PM	Jessica:	Just waiting for him to do his calm down, come out and be super sweet routine
	4:46 PM	Jason:	here’s hoping
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	so far not yet. Going to do the baked fish so let me know when you leave since I don’t have to much room for error on that one once I put it in to bake
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	Brenna now in her room as well, you may not want to come home.
	5:04 PM	Jason:	i’m nonetheless heading out now :)
	5:06 PM	Jessica:	Brave,brave man...that’s why I love you. Brenna is learning the art of apology/negotiation so she will be free when you get here.

	3:57 PM	Jessica:	Colby just got suspended for four days for punching a kid
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	so did the other kid though
	4:00 PM	Jason:	not good. but i thought boys punching was part of school.
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	that is odd, I guess girls are just more manipulative rather than physical
	5:47 PM	Jason:	honey, I’m home
	5:49 PM	Jessica:	On our way

Wednesday, December 17, 2014

	2:45 PM	Jessica:	So Bill just gave me a little tour of the new cement pad and solar panels (no longer has an electric bill) and Larry’s house just went up for sale :(
	2:45 PM	Jason:	oh. i wonder where larry is going. maybe we need solar panels.
	2:46 PM	Jessica:	he is buying something in wood duck (smaller I assume) by his girlfriend
	2:46 PM	Jason:	that makes sense. maybe we’ll get kids next door
	2:47 PM	Jessica:	I think it should be a requirement for us to approve anybody moving in there
	2:48 PM	Jason:	ha, good idea
	2:48 PM	Jason:	potluck here today
	2:48 PM	Jason:	in fact, i’d better go check on pie
	2:49 PM	Jessica:	don’t do it..walk away!
	2:52 PM	Jessica:	Jason, get back here!
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	salad for dinner for you!
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	I am assuming no response because you are busy eating pie (eye rolling)
	3:15 PM	Jason:	it was good pie
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	mmmhmmmm
	4:09 PM	Jessica:	bawling my head off right now. Your mom is the most amazing woman I know..period

	11:29 AM	Jessica:	get your coffee? Just finally back from running around here
	11:29 AM	Jason:	yep, nice breakfast with the team
	11:29 AM	Jason:	in a meeting now
	11:33 AM	Jason:	i hope you didn’t expose your soul to evil spirits last night
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	hahaha, me too
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	The whole thing is just strange to me, I am not sure what I believe with all of it as I am skeptical about everything, but what interests me is that they sincerely believe it and that they are seeing these things...that to me is more interesting
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	or REALLY creepy!
	11:39 AM	Jason:	some is confirmation bias. when you buy a jeep you suddenly see all the jeeps on the road. psychology. and yeah, psychology is interesting. :)
	11:46 AM	Jessica:	I do have something tonight for a bit, a play date at bodies in motion with Brenna
	11:47 AM	Jason:	i have a big gift here from joyce. if you’re out and about at all today, maybe you can grab it. :)
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	sounds good
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	When Brenna gets dropped off I can run by to pick that up
	3:23 PM	Jason:	sweet. sweets for you and sweets for me.
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	4:34 PM	Jason:	could you answer?
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	Brenna says the ONLY thing she wants for Christmas is an Anna doll. I wonder what she would do if that was the only thing under the tree
	4:55 PM	Jason:	i’m sure she’ll have the full stable of ponies lined up for christmas morning. she’ll hardly notice.

Friday, December 19, 2014

	9:52 AM	Jessica:	I love you, even if my morning required extra running around trips
	9:54 AM	Jason:	:) i love you too. why were there extra trips?
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	Because they were doing a book exchange today so I Brenna picked a Christmas one, we wrapped it and had to get a candy cane to put on it at the store. She then said something about when she brings the book home. I explained to her what a book exchange was, she was very upset because " Daddy reads me that one and makes all the funny voices, I don’t want to give it away!" So then I had to drop her off, go home, find a new one while making sure not to choose any from the others she told me are off limits because you guys read them (monster under the bed for example), re-wrap and head back to the school.
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	I swear I am developing ADD
	11:01 AM	Jason:	there are some drugs there for that
	11:02 AM	Jason:	what did you do?
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	I just start one thing, than find myself in the middle of two others things and not finished with any of them. Hot yoga for me shortly :)
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	ugh it’s raining
	1:58 PM	Jessica:	http://pruidaho.com/properties?addr=2234+S+White+Pine+Pl
	1:58 PM	Jason:	that wide angle lens makes the yard look so big
	1:59 PM	Jason:	how was yoga?
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	very true, haven’t gone yet because I wasn’t sure if Hunter was going to need a ride since he was finishing his test, his bus was 10 minutes late so he just made it
	2:03 PM	Jessica:	It looked like a swing set was being put in the backyard of that house on the corner that just sold, so maybe some more kids
	2:03 PM	Jason:	swing set is a good sign. i guess we can exercise some more tonight if you miss yoga.
	2:04 PM	Jessica:	good point, though we do have the comedy thing
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	More picks here: http://www.trulia.com/property/3174795120-Southshore-Sub-2234-S-White-Pine-Pl-Boise-ID-83706#photo-1
	2:21 PM	Jason:	Should you need entertainment
http://www.bonnercountydailybee.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/article_ecb06b30-7f70-11e4-876a-3b670c050f71.html
	2:51 PM	Jason:	So is it a movie we’re watching tonight? Should we bring popcorn? Trying to figure it out. :)
	2:53 PM	Jason:	i’d better just bring a flask
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	there is a bake sale, free popcorn and cocktails from what I can see
	2:55 PM	Jason:	still bringing the flask
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	;)
	2:55 PM	Jason:	looks like an adventure!
	2:55 PM	Jason:	(since i have no idea what it is)
	2:56 PM	Jason:	speaking of no idea, about to head over to the thing
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	yes, at this point though we may have to let the kids be here and watch a movie and call to check on them. It isn’t till later so they can watch guardian of the galaxy or Hunter said how to train your dragon 2 was good, we shall see

Monday, December 22, 2014

	10:16 AM	Jason:	i’m using a spreadsheet
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	I see that
	10:20 AM	Jason:	i wonder if grain drying needs software
	10:23 AM	Jason:	if you get bored, scroll through and put in some numbers, like how well financed the industry is and whether its required to meet legal mandates of some kind
	10:24 AM	Jason:	i’ll get some high scorers then search online to see who has the crappiest existing software
	10:24 AM	Jason:	unless you think there’s a better approach ?
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	Where are you finding those numbers?

	11:08 AM	Jessica:	oh well, it’s Christmas break, his work is caught up and he is about to be gone so

	11:26 AM	Jessica:	what has you looking at farming etc?
	11:27 AM	Jason:	just because those jobs were at the top of the naics list
	11:27 AM	Jason:	numerically
	11:27 AM	Jason:	low tech industries are probably great software opportunities
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	good point
	11:28 AM	Jason:	as long as they have money
	11:28 AM	Jason:	my ceiling leaked
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	oh no

Friday, February 13, 2015

	10:44 AM	Jessica:	I forgot how busy Goldies is. Haven’t been there in years.
	10:53 AM	Jason:	Even busy on a weekday?
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	yep, Kimberly managed to snag us a good table though :)
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	I just delivered to Brenna’s school some flowers and a dancing Valentines frog from us. I figured Hunter may not appreciate that so much ;)
	11:02 AM	Jason:	nice :) thank you for adding me to the “from”
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	I got you covered ;) Working up the motivation to workout, using Daily Burn, I like mixing it up with the hot yoga. The cardio one almost killed me yesterday though after 10 minutes...so sad.
	11:06 AM	Jason:	you’ve been on a roll this week, getting stuff done
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	busy is good. I do better when busy
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	and fyi, getting wide painters tape under the trim to protect the carpet is a PAIN!
	11:10 AM	Jason:	i checked it out this morning. looking good!
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	I have to do another coat on the trim here shortly. Traci and I agreed it needed to be white
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	good pea soup
	1:35 PM	Jason:	yea
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	And ice cream
	2:10 PM	Jason:	ooh

Monday, February 16, 2015

	9:42 AM	Jason:	Woah. Could you check the bill for Kayla’s phone? $78 for just two weeks? Our bill will be pushing $400/month
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	yes
	9:43 AM	Jason:	or maybe it was a bill for 6 weeks instead of 2 ... ?
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	I know I have to call in and suspend her account for another 3 months. They can only do it in 3 month chunks for a total of 6 out of the year
	9:46 AM	Jason:	ah. well, if they can’t reverse the charges (i imagine not) i’ll have to pull some back from distribution. that’s almost $100 more than what’s budgeted for phones
	9:47 AM	Jessica:	I will run in there tomorrow, it does look like it’s for 6 weeks
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	I will also cut our minutes back to the 700, with the new phone I can do calls on that one
	9:48 AM	Jason:	ha, it looks like i DON’T have any equipment coverage. just paying the deductible for a new phone must be the regular verizon service ... unless i’m missing something
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	that’s crazy
	9:49 AM	Jason:	laura and i have the same bill, no coverage
	9:50 AM	Jason:	if that’s how it works, you should drop yours. $10/month quickly overtakes that deductible cost
	9:51 AM	Jason:	did brenna let you sleep much? i couldn’t say goodbye because “shhh, i’m making a vide”
	9:52 AM	Jessica:	oh no she woke me up at 8:45 to ask where you were so she could have you get her breakfast as not to wake me up

	9:53 AM	Jason:	not bad. your call.
	9:54 AM	Jason:	i’d just ask the verizon guys at the store if i thought there’s was even the smallest change of a straight answer
	9:55 AM	Jessica:	yeah, the service at the one seems to be pretty spotty
	10:00 AM	Jessica:	Oh I am gooood

	1:34 PM	Jessica:	I had to take Brenna’s camera away
	1:34 PM	Jason:	uh oh. wasn’t listening?
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	she kept putting it in Hunter’s face and taking pictures, he was getting mad and I told her to stop, two minutes later she was being sneaky while he was putting away dishes and taking more pictures of him

	4:50 PM	Jessica:	20 minutes, I was gone 20 minutes, they called and managed to make messes in most rooms, mostly Brenna, Hunter just being antogonistic. They have been pretty good the last 30 min. Probably because their treat at Blue Cow was cancelled and if they want a piece of candy after dinner they have to be so good I don’t know they are here
	5:10 PM	Jessica:	should I start the taco salad stuff?

	4:03 PM	Jason:	did he make it to school today? it didn’t look like he was up but i thought he was skipping school to leave for his dad’s
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	no, I let him skip pe, I brought him
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	his flight is at 8:30 so I guess that won’t work. I’ll cancel
	4:04 PM	Jason:	well, it’s just  drop-off, right. i can do that. the initial bit is what’s more important. unless you were looking for an excuse. :)
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	No, I wanted to go, but now it looks like Hunter has once again lost his id so I’m not sure he can be dropped off
	4:11 PM	Jason:	what does it take without an ID? just someone with an ID to check him in?
	4:11 PM	Jason:	(i can type fast with short nails)
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	yeah
	4:12 PM	Jason:	you know the ID is in his room somewhere. if not, i can still do it. i could just stay in the call while driving.
	4:12 PM	Jason:	might not even take but a few minutes. just don’t know yet.
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	no, he says it’s in his wallet, in his back pack which he has lost..which explains why I haven’t seen the backpack in awhile. I am still searching his room
	4:15 PM	Jason:	oh, he lost his whole yellow backpack? bummer
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	yep
	4:15 PM	Jason:	can’t think of how that’s even possible. like losing the pants you’re currently wearing.
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	he said he left it in the gym and it was gone. Of course he hasn’t checked the office for it....so not sure I buy that story or he’s just that lazy
	4:17 PM	Jason:	i lean toward not caring enough to check
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	true
	4:18 PM	Jason:	he has to be checked as far as security then?
	4:19 PM	Jason:	i can do it
	4:19 PM	Jessica:	are you sure? yeah, I will print his boarding pass
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	Jess said they can take Brenna Friday from 3 until noon Saturday. I can have Tracy or Mattie pick her up for a few hours from there probably, until we get back
	4:21 PM	Jason:	yep, sure. and yeah, that will work. i’d better block out my friday afternoon.
	4:23 PM	Jason:	i’ve been typing in three chat windows. surprised none of you saw the wrong message.
	4:26 PM	Jessica:	aren’t you good
	4:45 PM	Jessica:	Can you print his pass DIIICD
	4:46 PM	Jessica:	Computer is offline upstairs
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	Brenna wants glasses
	5:00 PM	Jessica:	I was able to get it printed
	5:03 PM	Jason:	Brenna thinks she can’t see well?
	5:07 PM	Jessica:	I think she just wants glasses
	5:08 PM	Jessica:	I an about to go to Tracy’s to get ready, she has a couple dresses for me.

	10:52 AM	Jessica:	1316 after her 600 deposit is used towards it. She messaged me we might get something and that she is working with a “pre-law” friend to contest it, that they were supposed to replace the carper three years ago. You and I know how rental stuff goes though. She was going to call and tell me her strategy and such, she feels she is being ripped off. I told her to let you know what the plan is. The letter and invoices went to everyone and the co-signers on the lease
	10:56 AM	Jason:	Okay. I guess we’ll wait to see how that goes.
	11:01 AM	Jason:	You going to be out and about at all today? One of us needs to stop at the tax commission with that notice to tell them it’s zero. Has be physically delivered since the amount has “hardened”
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	I can do that. Get it all figured out? Do you have to de-register eye regard or something?
	11:04 AM	Jessica:	Looks like Malcolm is getting a new roof.
	11:04 AM	Jason:	I can do that later. For now just have to tell them it’s zero.

	4:07 PM	Jessica:	Working on it.
	4:21 PM	Jason:	expanding foam is still an option
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	good idea. He said if there was a good way to break your elbow this was it. She Chipped off a piecce of bone but not big enough that they need to put a screw in it. Sling for two weeks day and night, no pressure on it and that it will be pretty painful but after a couple weeks it will start feeling better and then it will take weeks to heal.
	5:03 PM	Jason:	as good as we can hope for
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	yes, no surgery. I had to go back tot he urgent care and get her a bigger sling though, nobody seemed to have a medium. Brenna keeps calling it a slingshot

	4:08 PM	Jessica:	I am going to be away tonight. I just need to step away at the moment.
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Okay. Sorry. I thought you’d said to go ahead and take you off the billing account.
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	That was not quite the conversation and at the moment, hell, I can’t even say what I feel at the moment because I am so mad and hurt and as usual it won’t matter, you don’t listen. Now you have just begun pretending you do which is a whole other ball game I can’t even deal with.
	6:45 PM	Jessica:	Kids are calling about food
	6:47 PM	Jason:	That’s funny, I haven’t seen them come out of their rooms
	6:50 PM	Jessica:	Point made
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	Kayla has some things she needs as well,  check with her
	7:04 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	11:20 AM	Jason:	That’s odd

	11:22 AM	Jessica:	Hahaha, it needed it anyway
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	poison ivy on her legs and a fissure in her bottom
	12:24 PM	Jason:	Wonder how she alone got the poison ivy. What’s a fissure mean?
	12:24 PM	Jason:	At least nothing contagious
	12:25 PM	Jason:	to prevent birthday
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	I know right. She said even if it only touched her in one spot it’s the skins reaction to the resin, so it can then spread allover. I need to wahs her sheets and clothing she was weraing. A tear in her bottom. Most likely from a large hard stool. Going to add some fiber powder in her milk. There is a a cream for you to pick up later at the pharmacy to help it feel better.
	12:29 PM	Jason:	sounds unpleasant. poor baby.
	12:30 PM	Jessica:	she got quite a few suckers out of it
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	still not motivated to get stuff ready for backpacking....
	2:16 PM	Jason:	maybe you should rub some poison ivy on yourself for an excuse
	2:17 PM	Jason:	i honestly expect you’d have fun once you’re out there but if you think differently, feel free to use me as an excuse in some way
	2:17 PM	Jessica:	funny, but kind of a good idea?? I just feel like I should be getting stuff done. I’m just off today I think
	2:37 PM	Jason:	you’ll know what you want
	2:42 PM	Jason:	i’m trying to tell myself i’m not itchy

	5:56 PM	Jason:	i have whiskey

	11:35 AM	Jessica:	Still sore, but just got off eliptical. About to get kayla from class. Her eyes are dilated so she can’t drive
	11:36 AM	Jason:	is she getting glasses?
	12:17 PM	Jason:	i’ve said i can pick up kaden and parker in twin falls on the 21st and bring them to the boise airport for a flight to moscow. any reason that wouldn’t work?

	12:29 PM	Jason:	it would be my day of driving, then, the 21st
	12:30 PM	Jason:	you must be getting work done :)
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	Dinner thing for assessment leaders and bwpw. Dinner for team and spouses
	12:45 PM	Jason:	i like dinner
	12:55 PM	Jessica:	I figured you would be okay with that ;)
	12:56 PM	Jessica:	Brenna may try and go with you to get the boys, be prepared. I may go play with the camera along the river in a bit.
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	I have to go to a meeting at East at 6:30 so need you to bring Brenna. I can pick her up
	1:25 PM	Jason:	sounds great. have fun along the river, if you go.
	1:58 PM	Jason:	could you plug in my tablet if you’re home? i’ll want it at gymnastics. i couldn’t see the cord to plug it in this morning without turning on the light.

Friday, November 6, 2015

	9:37 AM	Jessica:	you were quick with the list ;)
	10:19 AM	Jason:	transfers done. the grocery 250 is in your account. our distros were both reduced $300 again.
	10:20 AM	Jason:	i also reduced my distro by the amount i paid capital one, which pulls from billing
	10:21 AM	Jason:	i’ll pay minimum on hvac so i can cover the 720 imaging bill
	10:21 AM	Jason:	just keeping you in the loop :)
	10:21 AM	Jessica:	sounds like a plan
	10:22 AM	Jason:	we’ll have another pay period just in time to help with thanksgiving travel
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	that’s good. I thought we were staying here this year?
	10:39 AM	Jason:	not sure. whatever sounds good to you is fine with me. my mom has talked of us being at her place but i haven’t committed to anything.
	12:10 PM	Jessica:	To hell with this day
	1:09 PM	Jason:	oh darn. what  happened?
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	Between the medical bills issue, hemming my one pair of slacks for the luncheon, passing the location on the way only to wander around and find out it was yesterday....and kids calling. My morning had been off to a positive, productive start.
	1:13 PM	Jason:	oh, sorry. don’t worry about the medical bills. i’ll stay on top of sorting that. what are the kids needing?
	1:14 PM	Jessica:	I know, and I really do appreciate you taking care of everything and dealing with all of it. It’s just frustrating. Hunter wants picked up from school and I don’t know what Kayla wants, I ignored her call.
	1:15 PM	Jason:	They’re teens. It’s good for them to figure things out on their own. Go walk by the river and enjoy the beautiful sun.
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	Working on workshop stuff. Trying to get it filled. That will be + 700 in January. We are looking to maybe have me do it monthly
	1:18 PM	Jason:	Nice. I know you’re still working on our early retirement plan. ;)
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Heck, just bringing in money will be good at this point. So far I still have three companies committed for the begining of the year, so that’s good. Finally getting exposure and marketing in the right places. Helping sponsor some things the first 4 months of the year for the treasure valleys HR people. So finally getting a real launch, now to take advantage of that.
	1:21 PM	Jason:	seems to be based a lot on reputation and word-of-mouth. takes time to establish that.
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	Well my hair and makeup is done for today and I shaved. I guess today is about the little accomplishments :)
	1:21 PM	Jason:	And it’s beautiful out there
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	Yes, now that I have been getting us out there it is starting to help, plus money going into magazine articles, being in the right groups and on board of things is helping a lot
	1:23 PM	Jessica:	Alisa helps to get me in places to which is so helpful. Yes, it is sunny !
	1:23 PM	Jessica:	too
	1:24 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	1:27 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	Oh boy. I think maybe you need to get outside
	1:31 PM	Jason:	nice weekend for a jeep or motorcycle trip
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	You should get out on the motorcycle while you still can
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	Just picked up more poinsettia orders...1200! Almost $6500 total, biggest year EVER!
	3:01 PM	Jason:	nice. go out with a bang.
	3:01 PM	Jessica:	Exactly!
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Kayla:  " Mom, can you get some other soap, that ivory is making even my back break out now” Me: " yeah, we figured” guess she’s notin your club ;)
	3:27 PM	Jessica:	Are you going to meet me about 5:15?

	10:41 AM	Jessica:	Feet dry yet?
	10:44 AM	Jason:	they amazingly stayed dry, likely due to moving at the speed of sound
	10:49 AM	Jessica:	Most likely ;)
	1:09 PM	Jessica:	Working up the excitement to clean bathrooms  😝
	1:10 PM	Jason:	Or wait for the bathroom fairy
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	I got sheets washed and stew going, so the cleaning fairy should be more helpful

	4:53 PM	Jessica:	Save now.  They’re on,  I’m sweaty
	8:22 PM	Jessica:	My butt is sore

	10:50 AM	Jessica:	It is so weird here....
	11:09 AM	Jason:	last two checks had no ss deduction. checking with payroll.
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	how odd

	11:13 AM	Jason:	i did have a little raise in september, though, to 153,429, up about $120 per paycheck
	11:14 AM	Jason:	sorry, 135
	11:14 AM	Jason:	that was exciting for a moment
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Good idea.  Let me know what they say. What  a strange thing to have skipped.
	11:23 AM	Jason:	annual ss contribuations cap out at 7347
	11:23 AM	Jason:	after that you don’t contribute anymore
	11:23 AM	Jason:	wonder why they don’t fix the math to divide by 12
	11:25 AM	Jessica:	Ahh, that explains it. So expect the same next year. Good to know a little extra around the holidays ;)
	11:25 AM	Jason:	yeah. i’d rather have them just do division correctly.
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	yeah, messes with the numbers. That does seem odd
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	okay, going to get some cardio in before I dive into BWPW to do tasks.
	11:29 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:49 PM	Jason:	apparently govt requires 6.2% deductions even it means you’ll hit the max before year’s end
	12:51 PM	Jessica:	didn’t know that, but then I’ve never made enough in one year to hit the max!! Go you!

	2:08 PM	Jason:	nice job
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	okay, I laughed so hard I may or may not have peed a little bit...http://www.occupydemocrats.com/watch-colbert-mercilessly-mocks-palins-incoherent-trump-endorsement/

	1:58 PM	Jason:	must have been better for you than the others, though :)
	1:59 PM	Jessica:	true, I was proud of them for making it through the class. Good for me too with the weight stuff my muscles were really tight.
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	Will be finally heading home soon...to do dishes
	2:02 PM	Jason:	well that sounds fun
	2:02 PM	Jason:	i had two hours of meetings
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	darn it
	3:28 PM	Jason:	how’s the dish fairy?
	3:30 PM	Jason:	you need to put money back in the billing account immediately
	3:31 PM	Jason:	ACK. you also took money out of my account.
	3:31 PM	Jason:	YOU CANNOT DO THIS
	3:34 PM	Jessica:	I took money out for sleigh ride, gizmo and vet!
	3:34 PM	Jessica:	I told you that
	3:34 PM	Jason:	i’ll list the other expenses
	3:37 PM	Jason:	you said nothing about the vet expense and said you’d leave it up to me to transfer to billing
	3:37 PM	Jason:	there’s another $100 of transfers besides
	3:38 PM	Jason:	this has to be planned, not just transfers, willy nilly
	3:43 PM	Jessica:	I’m sorry, I’m not you. I have no money distributed other than child support that comes at random and is then in turn used to go back or for household/kids stuff like the The Springs and lunch, I don’t get to just use a card to the billing if I need gas etc or have a lunch meeting like you. I also don’t always know until that day, so to be clear I need to stop, call to see if I am allowed to get gas or anything else and get permission? Just so we are clear
	3:44 PM	Jason:	you keep saying “permission” but when i say to you, “hey, do you think it’s okay if I use X from billing?" it doesn’t seem like permission. it’s communication.
	3:45 PM	Jason:	and yes, if you can tell you won’t have enough gas money, say to me, “hey, mind if i transfer from money for gas."
	3:45 PM	Jason:	that’s exactly what i would do
	3:45 PM	Jason:	just so we both know where things are at.
	3:45 PM	Jason:	it’s easy
	3:45 PM	Jason:	i had no idea my account was depleted and that almost $500 was taken from billing. i only know what you tell me.
	3:46 PM	Jason:	somehow get past this idea that you’re communicating about money is permission
	3:47 PM	Jason:	i’m usually totally flexible about even big expenses if they aren’t a surprise
	3:48 PM	Jason:	i have no problem with the expenses themselves but i hate late feels, overdraft fees, etc., because there’s no communication
	3:48 PM	Jason:	i will submit my bodybuilding bill immediately to try to cover some of this

Wednesday, January 27, 2016

	10:56 AM	Jessica:	Can I get Heather some flowers for her birthday, just something small at the store

	3:10 PM	Jessica:	how are you feeling about it? Gut thought

	3:13 PM	Jessica:	if it makes you happy
	3:14 PM	Jason:	phbbt, what about you? i don’t want to invade your space if it makes you sad.
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	nope, you are fine..it’s the kids I’m hiding from
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	Really just two L shaped desks would work http://www.amazon.com/Linea-Italia-TR737OAT-L-Shaped-29-5-Inch/dp/B00KTQOC3Q/ref=pd_sim_sbs_229_32?ie=UTF8&dpID=41xzSDcCBEL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=11HJQB3FG2XDJ9VWHWE4

	10:14 AM	Jessica:	How was your meeting?  In a marketing meeting now.
	10:15 AM	Jason:	All good. They were shocked. Zeb is meeting with Jason and I in a week. Looks like your presentation went well.
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	It went really well.  I bet they were shocked!  That would be nice if Zeb works out. They would like working with him

	4:07 PM	Jason:	Soon, I guess

	4:52 PM	Jason:	now i’ll check yours
	4:54 PM	Jason:	it looks like you’ve spent exactly 70 so i’ll deduct that from the transfer to your account. now no more spending or transfers from billing. :)
	4:55 PM	Jason:	but let me know if you’re not getting child support on time since that’s part of your distribution
	5:05 PM	Jessica:	Nope, haven’t gotten it yet. Hopefully Saturday. From that 70: 15 hunter’s french class, 14 pull ups,  20 pastries and fruit (receipt submit for reimbursement )
	5:23 PM	Jason:	I know how it is. $100 of mine was movie and kid snacks. We can coordinate covering for child support if it isn’t here soon.

	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Bedtime......

Sunday, February 7, 2016

	3:45 PM	Jason:	Having “zero information” should never stop us from understanding this is part of a conspiracy between government and establishment media to dictate America’s cultural narrative. Understanding transcends evidence.
	3:45 PM	Jason:	The day’s favorite sarcasm
	3:48 PM	Jessica:	oh boy

Monday, February 8, 2016

	11:24 AM	Jason:	how 'bout this for a credenza? http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QUEF852/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=270WNYGFJ83CW&coliid=I9F7LKCJ04DX7&psc=1
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	Love it!
	11:26 AM	Jason:	kinda stylish
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	very
	11:30 AM	Jason:	i’ll try to get orders in today
	11:31 AM	Jessica:	Wonder what’s showing up today. I’m about to shower and blast music cleaning.
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	what all did you decide on?
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	our  office is going to be nicer than our house ;)
	11:34 AM	Jason:	spending half our lives there
	11:34 AM	Jason:	we should get a little rock fountain along with the plants
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	so true on both counts. I’m excited.
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	I am doing a decluttering of a room a day this week. Kitchen is today. If we don’t use it, it’s going. I see s few trips to good will this week. I’m going for minimalist
	11:44 AM	Jason:	I like minimalist
	11:45 AM	Jason:	I’m still struggling with Keurig. I calculate like $50/month in k-cups.
	11:45 AM	Jessica:	I’m fine with whatever :)
	12:34 PM	Jason:	http://www.amazon.com/Igloo-6-Bottle-Wine-Cooler-Black/dp/B00D02B8W4/ref=sr_1_28?ie=UTF8&qid=1454960019&sr=8-28&keywords=beer+bottle+fridge
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	Well duh, we need one of those!
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	Never fails. If I get in the shower, a delivery comes. Your monitors arrived
	12:42 PM	Jason:	didn’t have to sign?
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	Nope and surprisingly there was no fragile markings on the box so I wasn’t expecting monitors. I guess they are boxed separately withing the amazon box, but still.
	12:44 PM	Jason:	guess i better check 'em even though i won’t hook them up for a while
	12:46 PM	Jessica:	yep, I didn’t open the main boxes
	12:49 PM	Jason:	just sent a link to the stock agreement. do you think accounting lady has a few minutes to review? i imagine it’s mostly boilerplate
	12:49 PM	Jason:	then we both have to sign
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	I will message her
	12:56 PM	Jason:	current list: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/270WNYGFJ83CW/ref=cm_wl_list_o_4?
	12:56 PM	Jason:	i’ve sent the definitely-gaia list to andrew already. i’ll see how much of this separate list they want to cover.
	12:57 PM	Jason:	bluetooth receiver and cables to hook up these speakers i have at work
	1:04 PM	Jason:	hmm, what did i do differently. health plans looking closer to $900
	1:05 PM	Jason:	over $1000 if i match our current coverage
	1:06 PM	Jason:	ah, it’s having the girls on the plan.
	1:07 PM	Jason:	do either of them have any college coverage?
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	One sec
	1:08 PM	Jason:	having the girls on the plan almost doubles the price. that seems odd.
	1:11 PM	Jason:	matching current coverage with the girls, including dental, is $1200
	1:14 PM	Jason:	more expensive because the girls are adults now
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	It used to be that after two kids you weren’t paying for the others. Them being adults must have changed that
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	Though I though they could stay on our coverage until 26 now
	1:15 PM	Jason:	they can. you just pay, i guess
	1:15 PM	Jason:	i wonder if it’s cheaper for them to buy their own coverage, subsidized, and we reimburse them
	1:16 PM	Jason:	they’d have to be like adults, managing their own stuff
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	I know Kayla doesn’t. The school adds 1000 to their tuition if they don’t have insurance. That’s what Mattie pays anyway, I don’t think Laura does either since we get her bill statements
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	Plug it in for one of them and see
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	which site are you using?
	1:17 PM	Jason:	yourhealthidaho.org
	1:18 PM	Jason:	yeah, they’d have to buy insurance under their own names
	1:18 PM	Jason:	but you get subsidies if you’re poor
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	which as college students they are
	1:20 PM	Jason:	hmm, i’m still seeing about 200/month each
	1:21 PM	Jason:	even when i put their income at 2000/yr it says they don’t qualify for savings
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	Kayla technically has no income
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	Laura at the moment either
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	I’ll look at BSU options real quick
	1:26 PM	Jason:	maybe you could talk to one of the “navigators” or whatever they ended up calling them
	1:27 PM	Jason:	do we have a deductible with the current plan? i don’t remember having to use that up.
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	700
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	let me log in
	1:30 PM	Jason:	that’s the $1500 plan
	1:31 PM	Jason:	i see $1038.53 for $10 generics, $25 co-pay after $2500 deductible
	1:31 PM	Jason:	could go with higher deductible if we don’t think we’ll ever cross the threshold
	1:32 PM	Jason:	basically paying full price office visits all the time, then
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	yeah, things have been good. Just little stuff
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	http://healthservices.boisestate.edu/who-can-use-uhs/
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	more concerned about prescription coverage
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	every time I message you bells go off here
	1:39 PM	Jason:	i should log out of the stuff there, i guess
	1:39 PM	Jason:	seeing $123.20/m additional for dental
	1:40 PM	Jason:	so i guess if we can do anything better than $1200/month, it will be good
	1:41 PM	Jason:	i have 1200 in there for now
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cyo0PhLcOQgRN4yuVwUQDNpnZpxq-dtyFiKT_Bbtafo/edit#gid=21
	1:52 PM	Jessica:	Laura I know is covered right now under the study abroad program
	1:52 PM	Jessica:	So I think through May
	1:52 PM	Jason:	okay, that could save a bit
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	Let me get scotts info again. I know Hunter is covered under him as well..it’s just always been a paiin to bill both insurances
	1:55 PM	Jason:	i was already skipping hunter in these estimates
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	ok
	1:55 PM	Jason:	i think the pain has been the double coverage, right? if he was just covered by kaiser, maybe simpler
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	right
	2:06 PM	Jessica:	Sounds like I better close these contracts asap ;)
	2:10 PM	Jason:	We’ll have to do some math to determine if $1,200 a month is better paid on insurance or put in savings to self-insure, to some degree
	2:13 PM	Jessica:	yeah
	2:26 PM	Jessica:	Wonder how the kids are going to react to one bowl, plate & cup
	2:26 PM	Jason:	they’ll love it
	2:27 PM	Jessica:	It feels good to clean out stuff, even though it’s been a very late start
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	oooh, maybe one towel too!!!
	4:07 PM	Jason:	that’s a smart idea
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	I see you ordered stuff, I can’t see what but just that capital one flagged something
	4:34 PM	Jessica:	wow we have so much crap
	4:35 PM	Jason:	you’re still decluttering?
	4:35 PM	Jessica:	hahaha, it’s going to be a looong and awesome week

Tuesday, February 9, 2016

	12:56 PM	Jessica:	I’m trying to convince the laundry fairy to fold
	12:57 PM	Jason:	damn her

	12:39 PM	Jessica:	Damn it!!! I just spilled my bowl of tortilla soup all over the counter :(
	12:40 PM	Jason:	blame the kids
	12:45 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:17 PM	Jason:	did you get an e-mail from HelloSign for stock options?
	2:17 PM	Jason:	some days ago
	2:24 PM	Jessica:	yes
	2:24 PM	Jessica:	found it
	2:25 PM	Jason:	click to sign. you can write your signature with the mouse
	2:27 PM	Jessica:	what’s your social
	2:27 PM	Jason:	518197155

	2:31 PM	Jason:	(y)
	2:32 PM	Jason:	hey, that thumb is new
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	hey, it is
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	your electronics are very noisy today
	2:50 PM	Jason:	i thought i’d logged out
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	nope, things are beeping, buzzing and ringing over there ;)
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	I feel blah today
	4:14 PM	Jason:	you could build desks
	4:14 PM	Jason:	you probably wore your brain out these last days
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	If I had them, I would. Getting upstairs set up will let me get to more clearing out :)
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	I transferred 20 from your account for Brenna’s valentines stuff. That leaves 121 in your account, is that okay?
	4:16 PM	Jason:	oh sure. if there’s that much in there, no need to ask if it’s okay. just let me know. ;)
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	okay thanks. She’s busy putting them all together. I’m hoping to sneak a chocolate
	4:19 PM	Jason:	glad to hear i have enough for treats myself
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	I think she’s making you a special treat ;)

Thursday, February 11, 2016

	1:47 PM	Jason:	my beer was strong. i need to wait a few minutes to drive home.
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:52 PM	Jessica:	Yeah,  we don’t want you putting the desks together wrong
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	I took 200 out for grocery $ when I went and  got 7up and soup for hunter. I figured one day early was okay.  Just so you arent surprised or wondering
	2:33 PM	Jason:	(y)
	2:33 PM	Jason:	on my way
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	yay!

Unless you like flushing time and money down the toilet…"

	11:22 AM	Jessica:	Reposted with permission:
Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?
“I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, “What’s 2+2”? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We’ve had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can’t believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I’ll tell you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It’s probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it’s probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I’m being honest, I mean, if I’m being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he’s a zero that I don’t like. Though, I probably shouldn’t say that. He’s a nice guy but he’s like, “10101000101”, on and on, like that. He’s like a computer! You know what I mean? He’s like a computer. I don’t know. I mean, you know. 
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don’t tell you that, and I’ll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn’t believe it. That I can tell you. So, we’re gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."

Sunday, April 2, 2017

	10:14 AM	Jessica:	Good morning
	10:15 AM	Jason:	Time to get up
	10:16 AM	Jason:	What’s your plan today?
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	Get up!
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	Not sure, having coffee at the moment
	10:27 AM	Jason:	Same here
	10:28 AM	Jason:	Could was all the globs of mud off the Jeep but that sounds hard
	10:28 AM	Jason:	*wash
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	Bet yours is stronger
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	Ugh....
	10:28 AM	Jason:	Brenna drove it through a creek, not my fault
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	Aren’t you funny
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	What are your plans today?
	10:34 AM	Jason:	Sit around a while, maybe a little more grocery shopping, maybe walk by the river, maybe a lot of things
	10:34 AM	Jason:	Supposedly even more flooding now
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	You are more than welcome to do the winco trip ;)
	10:35 AM	Jason:	I would probably just do partial since you usually have some dinner plans in mind
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	Good point. Pleaese tell me the asparagus didn’t go to waste
	10:37 AM	Jason:	Was thinking of making it last night after we got back but will steam it up tonight
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:40 AM	Jason:	You may not remember when I wished the low sodium and spicy V8 would be combined into a single product. Well, I noticed it exists now. I like it.
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	Nice! I can start adding it to the list
	10:43 AM	Jason:	Yeah, need to find things I like as well as sugar :)
	10:49 AM	Jessica:	Haha
	11:04 AM	Jessica:	Ugh, Brenna and I have dentist appt Thursday morning
	11:04 AM	Jason:	Get 'er done
	11:04 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	I guess you have to do the orientation with Hunter so.......
	11:07 AM	Jason:	oh yeah
	11:09 AM	Jessica:	SHouldn’t be to much on your part, they are having parents work on paperwork while they interview kids, but his is all done. I will email you the no record juvenile piece tomorrow and you just need to go get his id
	11:09 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:10 AM	Jessica:	if you need to take him out of school or have him start late to make it easier go for it
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	not like it will hurt his grade at this point !!1
	11:13 AM	Jason:	maybe you could just put the info on our google calendar. then i can add reminders to it for myself.
	11:13 AM	Jessica:	ok
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	also, I haven’t touched the ICCU distribution because I assume it’s wrong and don’t want o mess up any transfers you need to do
	11:15 AM	Jason:	yeah, i need to revert some and also subtract camping expenses from mine
	11:15 AM	Jason:	actual distribution is $257 so you have that much :)
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	you can use some of mine for Brenna’s request if you want, I know you had to put lots of gas in the Jeep I’m sure
	11:17 AM	Jason:	okay, she’ll be happy. i need to buy a few small things for the yard so was waiting to see how balances looked before giving brenna her thing
	11:17 AM	Jason:	weed killer, fertilizer
	11:17 AM	Jessica:	yeah, just split the cost of the house, brenna, gas stuff between our accounts
	11:18 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:47 AM	Jason:	Brenna wants to call you
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	okay, done with my shower
	12:12 PM	Jessica:	tick drama...fun for you
	12:13 PM	Jason:	quick and easy compared to a sliver
	12:13 PM	Jessica:	oh good
	12:13 PM	Jason:	there’s no pain
	12:13 PM	Jason:	just psychological trauma. she’s staying naked to make sure no more are on her.
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	I’m really surprised with as much outdoor stuff over the years we haven’t gotten more
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	I caught that..she may be naked all day
	12:14 PM	Jason:	they’re only out in the spring. i actually thought about them while we hiked but didn’t think they would be out in the desert.
	12:14 PM	Jason:	now i know.
	12:15 PM	Jessica:	if she gets bratty you can easily mess with her the next day or two
	12:15 PM	Jason:	did keep an eye out for poison ivy but i know that doesn’t grow until autumn
	12:15 PM	Jessica:	yeah..I think that caused everybody psychological trauma
	12:16 PM	Jason:	i told it’s the same as a mosquito, just wants a little blood, but is a slower drinker
	12:16 PM	Jason:	now she’ll have two big things to share, driving the jeep and having a tick
	12:17 PM	Jessica:	yeah she took some of the responsibility for getting it dirty...but still said you did most of it
	12:17 PM	Jason:	maybe six creek crossings each way. i hit them fast on the way out to wash it.
	12:18 PM	Jason:	brenna wasn’t good at driving across the creek. she got confused about which way to turn. “just point at the road you see over there." didn’t work.
	12:19 PM	Jason:	she turned into a deep muddy spot, i had to stomp gas to keep us going
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	I am picturing this in my head
	12:22 PM	Jason:	she definitely liked it, got a bit stressed at times but i kept quiet and just slowed down when she got flustered with over-correcting, over-correcting.
	12:23 PM	Jessica:	oh good, better result than with Laura ;)
	12:24 PM	Jason:	yeah, i thought about that, though with brenna i still controlled gas/break, and not along hillsides so brenna could just drive off road a bit
	12:25 PM	Jason:	she kept saying “this is fun”
	12:25 PM	Jason:	she drove for 30-40 minutes
	12:25 PM	Jason:	i should say steered
	12:27 PM	Jessica:	wow, that’s a long time
	12:27 PM	Jason:	long dirt roads out there, especially when you’re driving 12mph :)
	12:31 PM	Jessica:	I’m a little jealous, sounds like you had fun
	12:32 PM	Jason:	it was a pretty good adventure. obviously you’ll see the full write-up :)
	12:32 PM	Jason:	we found Abbott Castle. brenna had myriad details worked out. keys, guard towers, sword room, princess tower, gate ...
	12:33 PM	Jessica:	oh boy
	12:33 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:34 PM	Jason:	the castle is right by our tent there
	12:34 PM	Jason:	had to hike all the gear in which was a fun challenge since i hadn’t packed for hiking. carried cooler, pillows, chairs, duffel, water jug, into canyon
	12:35 PM	Jason:	no people for miles and miles and niles
	12:35 PM	Jessica:	that is quite a hike in
	12:36 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:36 PM	Jason:	remind you of anyone?
	12:37 PM	Jessica:	you just gave me a heart attack, it’s fine when I do it..not when the kids do
	12:38 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:38 PM	Jason:	hike wasn’t too steep
	12:39 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:40 PM	Jason:	we have a new rock by the pond
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	of course
	8:02 PM	Jason:	What airline for Hunter? Apparently not SW.
	8:08 PM	Jason:	Hmm, I’m stumped. I’ve tried SW, Horizon and Delta without finding any arrivals close to 9:05.
	8:23 PM	Jessica:	alaska, always alaska
	8:24 PM	Jason:	Okay, that’s weird, they show no flight arriving then but I’ll just go and circle until I see him.
	8:24 PM	Jessica:	it’s only 8:30
	8:24 PM	Jason:	you said 9:05, so surely it’s departed. and the site shows every flight today.
	8:24 PM	Jessica:	oh thought you meant you were circling
	8:25 PM	Jessica:	one sec, I’ll check and call scott
	8:25 PM	Jason:	hold
	8:25 PM	Jason:	I see a 9:07
	8:25 PM	Jason:	i was searching the page for “05”
	8:25 PM	Jason:	since they have a lot
	8:25 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez...it’s picky
	8:26 PM	Jason:	Okay, it’s on time. I’ll leave here at its scheduled arrival. That usually works right.
	8:26 PM	Jason:	Brenna succered me into seeing Beauty and the Beast. I forgot it had singing.
	9:08 PM	Jessica:	The movie???
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	I am so jealous
	9:16 PM	Jessica:	And not at all surprised she suckered you, she’s a pro
	9:23 PM	Jason:	Hunter safely home
	9:27 PM	Jessica:	Thank you
	9:30 PM	Jason:	no problemo
	9:30 PM	Jason:	Is there a set gymnastics schedule or should I confer with Lee?
	9:36 PM	Jessica:	This week starts the new schedule, I updated the calendar. Brenna and Mya only share Wednesday & Friday now, Brenna has Tuesday instead of Monday, so you’ll need to take her Tuesday. I will see if Lee can do both Wednesday and I’ll do both Friday
	9:37 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:10 PM	Jessica:	He didn’t bring his Xbox back did he?
	10:10 PM	Jason:	I didn’t check his pack.
	10:11 PM	Jason:	Wouldn’t Scott know? He had a full backpack, that’s for sure.
	10:11 PM	Jason:	I can look while he’s gone tomorrow.
	10:11 PM	Jessica:	It was in a separate bag
	10:11 PM	Jason:	He only had his backpack.
	10:11 PM	Jessica:	Then he doesn’t have it
	10:16 PM	Jessica:	Sleep well, miss your voice
	10:17 PM	Jason:	Let me grab my phone

	7:33 PM	Jessica:	Hmmmm, coming from downstairs or garage?
	7:34 PM	Jason:	could be either. it was dark. I just said “hmm” and went back to bed.

i thought it might be brenna because she wanted me to wake her from her bed when i went to bed. but she was delusional so i left her.
	7:35 PM	Jessica:	Was he dressed or shirtless?
	7:36 PM	Jason:	mmm, 75% sure he was dressed
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	Ugh, that kid. I noticed his FB is gone
	7:36 PM	Jason:	oh, i didn’t see that. maybe you’re just unfriended.
	7:37 PM	Jason:	i think he’s just in the future now https://www.facebook.com/hunter.thomas.5680
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	Different Hunter, nope can’t find his profile
	8:26 PM	Jason:	having brenna earn computer time by improving stats on http://downloads.tomsguide.com/Typing-Rapid,0301-21882.html

Wednesday, April 5, 2017

	10:24 AM	Jason:	good dinner? the house plague is trying to get me again. probably because of less sleep these last few days.
	10:24 AM	Jason:	got everything turned in for hunter. lady said you get the gold star for having the most paperwork done.
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	Oh no, you better rest up
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	Yep good, it was easier/cheaper to just come in and get a cheap room since they are close to the airport rather than back and forth, also grandma was pretty worn out, I think she needed a night to herself to rest and have a breather before mom gets her tonight. It was an emotional day for her and she kept falling asleep
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	Oh good on the paper work, how was the rest of the orientation? What did Hunter think?
	10:36 AM	Jason:	it had good info though nothing we didn’t know. We got a handbook and a few more pieces of paperwork.
	10:36 AM	Jason:	Hunter was really sleepy again so hard to tell. He said it seemed neat.
	10:36 AM	Jason:	His interview seemed a lot longer than any of the other kids but he didn’t say anything about it.
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	I wonder what he is doing at night
	10:37 AM	Jason:	I don’t know. His door has been closed an light seems to be off when I go to bed about 10:00.
	10:38 AM	Jason:	He said he was be ahead of the others because of the formations he’s already learned in JROTC.
	10:38 AM	Jason:	I asked what he thought but he just said “seemed alright” or something.
	10:39 AM	Jessica:	are you able to see if he is connecting any devices to the wifi? Wonder if he’s gotten ahold of another phone.
	10:40 AM	Jason:	Yeah, I can see other devices. I haven’t checked lately.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	haven’t had a chance to wash the jeep yet. brenna said she would do it.
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	haha, I can hose it I’m sure, I owe you for all the running around you have had to do
	10:48 AM	Jason:	forgot about its tags (expired) but ordered them so its legal
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	good job
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	Head hurting or stuffy?
	11:22 AM	Jason:	Some headache and sore throat
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	you just want head rubs
	11:33 AM	Jason:	couldn’t hurt
	2:54 PM	Jessica:	Flight delayed, terminal packed
	2:54 PM	Jason:	:(
	2:54 PM	Jason:	that’s right, you get the grand tour on the way back
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	L.A. layover, shorter now though
	2:58 PM	Jessica:	Home at 11:11 so will grab uber
	2:59 PM	Jason:	i don’t mind driving but up to you
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	I’ll let you grab me 😜
	2:59 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Have Hunter call me when home, curious about his interview
	3:11 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	You know to pick up the girls on the other side right?
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	All 3
	3:12 PM	Jason:	i’ve never picked up 3
	3:12 PM	Jason:	what other side?
	3:13 PM	Jessica:	Actualy just her and Mya. The bown side, I just pull up by the curb, or few spots to the left
	3:15 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:00 PM	Jessica:	good conversation with Hunter
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	oh great..all the flights are delayed
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	may be a good thing, it originaly was going to make me miss my connecting, now it may work. If not they are looking at me getting another flight coming in at 11:30
	4:41 PM	Jason:	did he explain the long interview?
	4:43 PM	Jessica:	yes, he said he got the owner/director? So he asked a lot and Hunter asked him quite a few questions..the guy said that he had a good chance of getting a spot because he hasn’t had a problem with drugs or issues with police
	4:44 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:44 PM	Jessica:	but that the first 11 days they can’t speak to anyone, not even other trainees, just alot of working out and then on the weekend they will get a quick few minute call..to start
	4:45 PM	Jessica:	he seemed shocked but excited about coming back totally ripped
	4:45 PM	Jason:	i didn’t hear about the no-talk 11 days, sounds like a little poetic license compared to what i heard :)
	4:46 PM	Jessica:	and that they get a years worth of school done so he would be caught up and a bit ahead..we talked about the benefits of his senior year not being stressfull because right now he would have a super heavy load just to MAYBE graduate with his class
	4:46 PM	Jason:	but good he’s excited about some parts
	4:46 PM	Jason:	right, several of the “graduates” talked about how it caught them up or let them graduate early
	4:47 PM	Jason:	sounds like he was listening!
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	he definitley bought into the “scholorship” idea that this a 17k spot he would be earning, and that they do his military testing at the beginning and help them toward the are they want to go into and then test them again at the end..so it would help him a lot military placement wise
	4:49 PM	Jason:	ah, they didn’t emphasize that to us, just that the supplies cost (around $300) is more than offset by all the meals they get fed
	4:49 PM	Jason:	to us (parents) they emphasized they’re not a military org, not funneling to military, just applying the style
	4:50 PM	Jessica:	it’s 22 weeks residency..300 would be a deal..and getting him graduated...priceless
	4:50 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:51 PM	Jason:	as for talking, no calls for the first two weeks then a few minutes on weekends depending on privileges earned
	4:51 PM	Jason:	they can call whoever they want
	4:51 PM	Jessica:	we discussed his current grades, talked about trying to get as many to pass so that they aren’t more to make up. He actually pulled to F’s to D’s that could easily be C’s..so that’s something
	4:51 PM	Jessica:	yeah, he mentioned that..he was a bit shoocked but was easily sidetracked by being super in shape and happy it was co-ed...BWAHAHAHA
	4:52 PM	Jason:	they repeatedly emphasized that boy/girls have zero contact, not in same areas
	4:52 PM	Jason:	glad he’s excited to get fit
	4:53 PM	Jessica:	exactly...but we’ll let him think it’s a benefit.....
	4:53 PM	Jason:	and knowing him, he’d enjoy the military get-up, marching around
	4:53 PM	Jessica:	I think so too
	4:53 PM	Jessica:	Here is my Delta conf# if you want to track me...it keep changing GZJH4V
	4:53 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	did they give an idea of timeline for knowing if accepted?
	4:55 PM	Jason:	no, just that the sooner we can supply materials, the better
	4:55 PM	Jason:	didn’t really say there was a hurry, though
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	I have the next pieces mostly, just need to see if Terry will do the Mentor portion and paperwork, his colonel is retiring so can’t commit
	4:56 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:00 PM	Jessica:	the benifits of the whole online school debacle..I had lots of stuff already together, just refilling out the same info
	5:01 PM	Jason:	silver lining
	5:01 PM	Jessica:	yeah, and now that he’s been back..I don’t think the online thing would have gone well for us
	5:02 PM	Jason:	agreed
	5:02 PM	Jason:	i’m gonna go lay down and listen to a podcast or something
	5:03 PM	Jessica:	good idea, I can get a ride home, it’s turining out to be late and you should sleep
	5:03 PM	Jason:	if i feel dead tired i’ll bail out bought i’ll let you know first
	5:03 PM	Jason:	*bought = but
	5:03 PM	Jason:	funny typo
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	you need to go lay down ;) I’ll keep in touch as I land
	8:36 PM	Jessica:	Sooo tired, landed, about to board
	9:12 PM	Jason:	I think I’ll defer to uber after all even though I’m excited to see you
	9:15 PM	Jessica:	No worries my love
	9:15 PM	Jessica:	Rest

	8:14 AM	Jason:	Is insurance updated here
	8:17 AM	Jessica:	yes
	8:21 AM	Jessica:	💤😴😵
	8:21 AM	Jason:	Didn’t realize it was making that noise. I should have checked.
	8:22 AM	Jason:	Better check finances today. Might put us behind.
	8:22 AM	Jessica:	I never heard it until silver city when we got back, it would squeak in reverse out of the driveway the last couple weeks but no grinding
	8:23 AM	Jason:	Que sera sera :)
	8:23 AM	Jason:	They have no coffee here
	8:24 AM	Jessica:	always another bill..guess that’s where most of the 6/15 extra check will be going...eventually I’ll get my vent! 😂
	8:24 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I even brought my creamer to try and drink the bad coffee here
	8:26 AM	Jessica:	I’ll also get an idea from our employee benefits guy on insurance etc, to give us an idea of what we will be saving when that kicks in next month
	8:26 AM	Jessica:	how’s Brenna doing? bring a stuffed animal or scratchy?
	8:41 AM	Jason:	brenna did fine. all done and home now.
	8:43 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	8:44 AM	Jessica:	Oh good, she’s all patched up, fixed up and good for summer
	8:44 AM	Jessica:	Lee will be picking her up for gymnastics
	8:44 AM	Jason:	Okay, what time is that? I’d better warn her.
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	I updated the calendar, she has gymnastics Mon, Tues & Thur 4-8. Lee will bring them Mon & Thur and I will pick up. Tuesday is still our day we do both for Brenna only
	8:48 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Coffee...not working
	10:29 AM	Jason:	I tried to sneak some of your creamer. It didn’t work.
	10:40 AM	Jessica:	haha, I brought it today knowing I’d be desperate for coffee and it is really strong here
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	still couldn’t drink it..glad we are switching companies
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	starving
	10:41 AM	Jason:	Brenna is after me about “summer shopping”
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	yea, I had planned on getting a few summer clothes at shopko, they have 50% off in girls right now. Just a few shorts, tanks and a swimsuit. It can wait until payday next week ..even though she will pout I’m sure.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	was she happy to get tooth fairy $?
	10:52 AM	Jason:	yes. she said thank you.
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	that tooth case was cute..the tooth not so much
	10:59 AM	Jason:	i never looked at it. brenna kept it close. and it was dark last night.
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	it looked okay because it had just been filled..just teeth in general pulled are disgusting I think
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	Nick picking up Brenna for gymnastics, Lee will already be out that way and wondered if you could take her..obviously without a car not possible 😉
	1:01 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:06 PM	Jessica:	Talked with Max, there are no penalties, taxes etc. The only thing it does is reduce our death benefit by the same percentage..but we aren’t using it for death benefit (our other policies are for that) so no impact. Same amount will continue to pull monthly and go into what we are basically using as a “savings account”
	2:08 PM	Jessica:	As he put it, if we wanted to pull money and go to Disneyland it would be fine, it’s for whatever we choose. Just that if we do use it for education to take advantage of that tax credit I told you about.
	3:12 PM	Jason:	Sounds good. Thanks for checking.
	3:28 PM	Jason:	Are there any chores I need to encourage Hunter to finish before you get home?
	4:27 PM	Jessica:	Yes, I reminded him vacuuming and his floor

	11:43 AM	Jason:	girls are off
	11:43 AM	Jessica:	I want to get it all going, so much work..I want movement. It’s motivating now that I have ducks in a row with others out of the picture, have all the programs/content in order and know I will be able to start putting some money towards my ads etc. also, the work schedule keeps me more on task

	11:39 AM	Jason:	oh, i haven’t heard a peep so just figured. usually i can hear the game.

	8:39 AM	Jessica:	Brenna could really take it up a notch
	9:14 AM	Jason:	better not show her those
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	yeah, she would become the culprit of missing lighters
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	my head......
	9:27 AM	Jason:	seemed like you slept better. bummer it still hurts. music kept me awake 2-3. i feel tired.
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	Sudafed helped knock me out. Yeah, I got on him this morning, he fell asleep with it on. I’ll remind him to turn it off BEFORE falling asleep
	9:42 AM	Jason:	a song would wake me up then it would get quiet and i was so tired i’d think i could just fall back asleep. then another one would wake me up. but i would think the same thing. :)
	9:42 AM	Jason:	glad the sudafed helped
	9:42 AM	Jason:	i want new emojis
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	oh lordy. I’m surprised I don’t have nightmares about the cherub devil vampire
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	Just took more sudafed. Hoping it helps rather than makes me sleepy
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	Do you still have the thinner black table i the garage or did you sell it?

	2:22 PM	Jessica:	Yep, I’m assuming pick up, were just been keeping the same
	2:23 PM	Jason:	she wants to do a make-up and keep playing at the girls’ house today
	2:23 PM	Jason:	she’s falling on the floor crying, actually
	2:23 PM	Jason:	i can send a picture
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	she had her one for the month, that was the deal. It’s really inconvenient to do a makeup because they are 9-1
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	she can take a break and play after or all day tomorrow
	2:28 PM	Jason:	NO
	2:28 PM	Jason:	that was brenna
	2:28 PM	Jason:	i’ll get her brain ready
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	she messes pick up for mya if she misses on a Monday or Thursday as well. If she’s going to be a brat she can be grounded from playing tomorrow

Tuesday, June 27, 2017

	9:44 AM	Jessica:	Scott has lost what little of a brain he had left..I could punch him
	9:44 AM	Jason:	uh oh
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	He took Hunter in for blood work because he doesn’t feel he is big enough. Even though Hunter told him he see his doctor every 6 months and is fine, that he has had a growth spurt and he is the same size as many of his friends and that he just had a physical
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	Scott didn’t speak with his doctor, ask for his records..nothing
	9:46 AM	Jason:	that’s weird
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	but didn’t get his dentist appointment done for the filling
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	Put him down for his size, puts him down for wanting to go into the military..did all of that again
	9:47 AM	Jason:	if only he knew who his mother was, might explain his smaller size when he was younger
	9:47 AM	Jason:	crazy
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	right? and Tolman says he’s on track, half his friends are the same size..Scott in mental
	9:49 AM	Jason:	we’ll get hunter off to school soon then it will be up to hunter who he spends his few minutes of weekly phone time with
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, his dad already fought with him about that too. Told Hunter he expects him to call every Sunday, got mad when Hunter told him he’ll want to call his friends
	9:52 AM	Jason:	can write as many letters as he wants
	9:52 AM	Jason:	we should probably start writing some now, actually
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	Hunter also doesn’t plan on going there for Christmas, technically he doesn’t have to since Scott had him both holidays this last year, Hunter doesn’t want to visit more than the week in the summer or occasional 3 day weekend
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	good idea
	9:55 AM	Jessica:	I think he is really tired of the crazy controlling, the constant put downs and seeing how his dad lives and not wanting that
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	I just can’t believe he did that to him
	9:57 AM	Jason:	definitely odd. like taking brenna for a “test” to see why she’s shy sometimes. makes it seem like a defect.
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	exactly...and bloodwork? What the hell.
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	Holy moly..5 phone calls later...Hunter has a dentist appt across the street Thursday at 9:30
	10:31 AM	Jason:	crikey. i’ll make sure he makes it.
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	it took me forever to figure out his dental insurance and how to use it over here since it’s Kaiser
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	since Scott can’t manage to get me the info
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	I really want to punch him
	10:44 AM	Jason:	brenna had a dream that you went crazy and died
	10:44 AM	Jason:	she needs proof of life
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny, she can call me 208-947-5201
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	Grab and go breakfast
	10:52 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:53 AM	Jason:	brenna might already have forgotten about you. i yelled down that she could call. she said okay. haven’t heard back.
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	guess she’s not to worried
	11:13 AM	Jessica:	Now I’m sad she didn’t call
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	I get plants for the front :)
	11:56 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:59 PM	Jason:	fly purge underway. all violence is allowed on this day.
	2:10 PM	Jessica:	That is funny
	2:11 PM	Jason:	now my eye is foggy. it’s like that stuff is poison.
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	oh boy
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	oh this day....
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	Meeting Janet to go over some web stuff
	5:02 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	1:17 PM	Jason:	would i be able to use the jeep tonight or tomorrow to go grab the motorcycle forks? they close at 6:00. it’s over by wings.
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	yep, I’ll get home quick. Also, I need to talk to Tony or DAve for a truck tonight to pick up the piano. If you happen to have a moment to go ask Tony..also need to track down a ramp
	1:46 PM	Jessica:	wait I guess we have the trailer, probably still need a ramp thought
	1:46 PM	Jessica:	though
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	OMG..Tiny House Paradise is about to premier! TIny House & Beach life all rolled into one!!!
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	correction: Tiny Paradise
	3:40 PM	Jason:	hmm, why did calendar just tell me to get brenna ready for gymanstics. just an old reminder i hope.
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	It told you to pick her up from school because you haven’t erased those, they are on their daily still
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	there

	11:32 AM	Jason:	Are there particular Brenna chores I should scrutinize before more computer time?
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	her list, the first sheet has to be done
	11:51 AM	Jason:	She seems to be on it. Very motivated by the house building game.
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	nice
	12:32 PM	Jason:	Do you think Hunter will send us letters?
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	I was wondering the same thing, I’m hoping so
	3:12 PM	Jason:	I need to update my calendar. It’s not a gymnastics day is it?
	3:15 PM	Jason:	I think it’s clear now. I removed my own gymnastics event and now just the one you added is left.
	3:31 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:38 PM	Jason:	Sarah Marple friended me. Prelude to wedding photo request?
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	Haha, possibly
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	Is it 5 yet??
	4:07 PM	Jason:	almost
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	I’ll hit winco on the way home

	9:57 AM	Jason:	Next letter done, I think https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ewSvHLXT3F5S48vyUKIYtm7T0pa5VS5wrz-MhNbehGc/edit
	10:03 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:11 AM	Jason:	just added a bit. i’ll leave it alone now. :)
	10:20 AM	Jason:	really need him to make it through these first weeks otherwise i’m afraid he might be turned off to the military too
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	my concern as well. I have heard from lots o parents that their cadets went through the same thing, that it was worth it, that their cadets were so happy they stuck it our or that the parents made them. I’m also chatting with a previous employee there, she said mail is huge and that after the first two weeks they have a big ceremony, they get their uniforms and they start working with the teachers who are amazing...we just have to get him to that point. The counselor is talking with him today. Terry shooting him a letter today as well
	10:33 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:34 AM	Jason:	I’m happy to do daily letters for a while. I can hook the printer up here if it’s a pain to print/send there.
	10:35 AM	Jason:	I sort of considered how much army comparison to make since it could have that opposite effect. He likes to take pride in things he believes he’ll do in the future so rolled those dice.
	10:36 AM	Jason:	still sounds more like boredom and just not being able to goof off than rigor that’s bothering him
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I think once the schooling and activities start it will be easier. Just have to get through this really tough two weeks
	11:02 AM	Jason:	that’s a great relief (the e-mail). i’ll tweak the letter i was working on for tomorrow. :)
	11:03 AM	Jason:	i’ll still try to stick with the everyday letter plan for a bit.
	11:05 AM	Jessica:	agreed, I’ll get mine out today as well. Knowing he is doing so much better changes what I wrote.
	11:06 AM	Jason:	i think my today’s letter is still okay. i was getting a little deeper for tomorrow but now i’ll shift gears a bit.
	11:07 AM	Jason:	tomorrows: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G0pe0gIKty8XXJ9VmGMGkJVwUnw2VyrDJ_qEbcoClaQ/edit
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:21 PM	Jessica:	letters mailed
	3:21 PM	Jason:	you’re awesome
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	thanks for writing him, I think he will be happy to be getting them not just from me..and yours are more interesting 😂
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	reminder Brenna needs to be ready
	3:39 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:53 PM	Jason:	They haven’t showed up yet
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	Oh he’ll, we hadn’t touched base, just assumed since we agreed unless messaged to keep it that way
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	Hell
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	Mys is at camp in McCall, Lee forgot to tell me...ugh
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	She’s going to have to do a makeup next week, I’m sure Mya will be too so that should work
	4:13 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	she’ll probably be happy for the break. Can you remind her to load the dishwasher
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	this day has been brutal
	4:25 PM	Jason:	i’ll remind her. almost done.

	10:58 AM	Jason:	yep. she’s working on our closet now.
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	😁
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	Caribbean life is on again.....
	11:01 AM	Jason:	she reminded me she has no contacts on her gizmo. it’s charged, she says.
	11:01 AM	Jason:	closet looks good. was going to give her time then have her pick up sleeping bag, etc., before time after that.
	11:10 AM	Jessica:	okay, I’ll also add contacts again
	11:13 AM	Jason:	she was standing in her room playing the uke and singing
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Video?
	11:14 AM	Jason:	she got mad at me for looking
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	11:21 AM	Jessica:	she needs to charge her gizmo and turn it on for the contacts to update
	11:24 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:03 PM	Jason:	I think I see Hunter https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-1-of-Class-172/i-2T3xFTV/A

	9:09 PM	Jason:	I think it’s too late for that movie there since it’s opening night.
	9:10 PM	Jason:	We were just outside watching for you while we worked on the motorcycle. :)
	9:14 PM	Jessica:	Sharse, Mattie and brenna want to know if you guys can come get Brenna then so I can stay, she can’t stay after 8

	11:01 AM	Jason:	woah, raindrops
	11:17 AM	Jessica:	I heard it was raining earlier, it was cloudy and muggy when I left
	11:17 AM	Jessica:	about to finish up my letter. I am going to do a list of questions that he can just answer/fill in and send back :)
	11:17 AM	Jason:	that’s smart
	11:18 AM	Jessica:	Trying to get a response and indo :)
	11:20 AM	Jessica:	*info
	11:23 AM	Jessica:	Brenna can’t have more screen time until she THOROUGHLY cleans her bathroom that she trashed and puts dishes away now that I cleaned and re-ran it
	11:26 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:26 AM	Jason:	this will do https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmslYUKH1znSfgL-KSYcQQPYwHa_lOwmVQA9YYOM3Cs/edit
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	printed :)
	11:28 AM	Jason:	i’m trying to earn the highest word count bead
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	My mom is sending Hunter some books, I told her one at a time. I think the “grandparents” that wrote Hunter that surprised him may have been Doug, he wrote him immediately. A bit surprising for sure
	11:31 AM	Jason:	ah, that kind of make sense. hopefully nobody resorting to scripture quotes that will be meaningless
	11:31 AM	Jessica:	oh god I hope they aren’t that stupid
	12:58 PM	Jason:	did you see hunter? https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-T3X4753/A
	12:58 PM	Jason:	that’s his normal photo face lately :)

	1:00 PM	Jessica:	yay...he’s alive!!
	1:00 PM	Jessica:	yeah...his pissy camera face I call it
	1:00 PM	Jessica:	hahaha, in all three same face
	1:01 PM	Jason:	seems like they were shot in quick succession with a zoom lens. all the kids in almost exact same position.
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	yeah
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	And my fern is still alive I bought
	1:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:21 PM	Jason:	nice
	1:24 PM	Jessica:	I still have one large one being delivered too...woohooo!! I may need to sneak the ones there in and let them get them healthy again :)
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Mentors are allowed to email, jealous. I forwarded you Terry’s email to Hunter
	4:19 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s easier.
	4:48 PM	Jessica:	Epic
	4:53 PM	Jason:	that’s funny
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	He was goood..okay getting ready to leave.
	4:54 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Tuesday, July 25, 2017

	9:32 AM	Jason:	Not so grumpy here https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-LcpZBL3/A
	9:33 AM	Jason:	almost a smile? https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-XmBqjtz/A
	9:35 AM	Jason:	whatever new shoes we get for him, need something distinctive again
	9:35 AM	Jason:	maybe greyish-pink?
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	That makes me so happy!!
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	Hahaha, I wish I could send him bright orange ones!
	10:01 AM	Jessica:	FYI, I transferred in order to get his new boots & shoes only to have to transfer back to the billing because I didn’t have my card on me so ordered from the billling account. Humana depostied back 106 and water already came out for 115 on the 17th. So not sure if you want to transfer anything, may want to take a look. I sent the return label for the others to his counselor, she is working to get them sent out so we get a refund.
	10:02 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:09 AM	Jessica:	wait...BRIGHT shoelaces maybe I could sneak in the order :)
	10:09 AM	Jason:	perfect idea
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	SWEET! The new boots had a delivery of 31st-3rd. I messaged and they are expediting for two day delivery :)
	10:23 AM	Jason:	nice
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	this writer is hilarious http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/donald-trump-boy-scouts-speech/index.html
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	:)
	11:08 AM	Jason:	I guess this one is good to go https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x7amBvJagkobDfRvYdhu8srZoevgBYSXcPpqOvsfK_Q/edit
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	No screen time..unless chores done and bathroom CLEAN
	12:00 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:59 PM	Jason:	I didn’t catch what you said while leaving today. Is it not a normal gymnastics day?
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	today is gymnastics, Mya is doing a make-up day. Just messaged Lee to see if Aron is picking up or not.
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	She may get a break day Thursday, I have to confirm with her coach
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	Nice lunch with Terry
	1:09 PM	Jessica:	I think my payback for him mentoring Hunter is to let him vent about dealing with Tracy’s kids ;)
	1:10 PM	Jason:	:)
	1:11 PM	Jason:	Okay, I’ll wait to hear from you on bringing Brenna. She’s already in her outfit. Thought lately she goes between bathrobe and leotard.
	1:12 PM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	Aaron will be getting Brenna
	1:28 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:28 PM	Jason:	i’ll go have emissions checked when they leave then
	1:28 PM	Jason:	working on tomorow’s letter
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	I think you should write some " Any Cadet” letters too/to :)
	1:31 PM	Jason:	i could just change the name on some i’ve already written
	1:36 PM	Jason:	“how long do i have to not be happy” when i told her she was done with screen time
	1:36 PM	Jason:	*brenna said
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	Tell her she is more than welcome to work on the chore list for extra time. The dishwasher is also clean and putting away can be worth time towards “being happy”
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	Cleaning up the back porch: Sweeping patio, cleaning table etc could also go towards “making her happy”
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	Have lots of ways to maker her happy :)
	1:55 PM	Jason:	yeah, i can mention that. i still don’t want her looking at a screen all day.
	3:26 PM	Jason:	I see a kid with red shoelaces so neon wouldn’t be too weird
	3:33 PM	Jessica:	I’m getting them then!
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	done! Neon green :)
	3:41 PM	Jason:	he’ll love it
	4:21 PM	Jessica:	After the boot debacle...they better let him keep them!!!
	4:22 PM	Jason:	yeah really

	9:35 AM	Jason:	I think the next one is ready https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y79TRT31UR02KBMUxllLoMGh8hphW4iSq8o6LRRDXNo/edit
	10:07 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:07 AM	Jessica:	I just moved a tree
	10:26 AM	Jason:	new plant?
	10:28 AM	Jason:	or printing lots of paper
	10:29 AM	Jason:	i didn’t even realize they have a pool there. that’s nice. https://www.facebook.com/jennifer.anickerbillups/posts/10209708141281108
	10:31 AM	Jason:	look like hunter in the front but hard to be sure https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209708084719694&set=pcb.10209708141281108&type=3&theater
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	No, moving the fake tree to make room for my new live plants coming :)
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	Wow, I had no idea about the pool either..nice!
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	it is him!
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	So quiet in  here today...yay!!
	1:25 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	I could easily do that. Printing off funny face emojis for Hunter instead.
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	guess what?
	1:51 PM	Jason:	What?
	2:10 PM	Jessica:	if Brenna stays at Kayla’s tonight it’s just us!
	2:10 PM	Jessica:	also, remind her to write Hunter a letter..or picture or something
	2:11 PM	Jason:	😘
	2:11 PM	Jessica:	I’m about to print up a sheet of mailing labels 😁
	2:19 PM	Jason:	smart
	2:40 PM	Jason:	mr. huntet https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-ZFnmSmQ/A
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	i WAS just ABOUT TO CHECK!!
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	oops, caps lock on
	2:42 PM	Jason:	https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-tHnbh5C/A
	2:43 PM	Jessica:	wow, LOTS of him :) :)
	2:43 PM	Jason:	doesn’t look too terrible
	3:05 PM	Jessica:	I bet they enjoyed some fun time
	3:14 PM	Jessica:	These few are also him...those white stripes came in handy :) I’ve only seen one other kids with them that is obviously not Hunter https://idyca.smugmug.com/Class-172/Week-2-of-Class-172/i-StR3Bzq/A
	3:15 PM	Jason:	we’ll have to get the big copies of those when the week is up
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:16 PM	Jessica:	Have you seen anything that says what time family day starts?
	3:16 PM	Jason:	no
	3:53 PM	Jessica:	reserved a room at the super 8 in Grangeville, I forgot it’s also labor day weekend so there were only 3 rooms left and other hotels sold out...or there was still room at the downtowner 😂
	4:13 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Thursday, July 27, 2017

	10:40 AM	Jessica:	I could still sleep more
	10:58 AM	Jason:	put a pillow under your desk and crawl down there?
	10:59 AM	Jason:	Working on next letter
	11:07 AM	Jason:	writer’s block today
	11:24 AM	Jason:	that’ll do https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9wMEV2Brr5iJWmiElSQGGmCYAgw16jCQp2BYpFFKVI/edit
	11:25 AM	Jason:	You sent a link.
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, switching from coffee to tea..my Swedish fish came in THEY ARE individually wrapped 😂😂😂
	11:28 AM	Jason:	oh boy
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	that’s probably a good thing, I’ll eat less
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	I have my jelly bellies stashed
	11:34 AM	Jason:	Asked my brothers if we can have our ride in this area.
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	I’m assuming the area is the Pierce area
	12:41 PM	Jason:	No, this area, Boise
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:59 PM	Jason:	They’ve agreed. So it shouldn’t be a problem for me to join you for Family Day.
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	😘😍
	1:10 PM	Jessica:	Jelly Bean time!!
	1:15 PM	Jason:	I had a couple then hid them from Brenna for now
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	I miss the monster
	1:35 PM	Jessica:	Hunter’s boots arrived, shoes and laces expected by tomorrow. I told her to hold them for ransom AFTER he writes us a positive letter :)
	1:35 PM	Jessica:	IT’s worth a try
	1:35 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:35 PM	Jason:	good idea
	2:20 PM	Jessica:	My check won’t have $$ deducted this time Sarah just told me, she said she does it in real time so the payments don’t start coming out until the 15th, at which point they will be 834. Though our coverage is still effective the 1st
	2:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:22 PM	Jessica:	not that the payments will be 834 😂😂 that’s crazy. The checks will be $834
	2:26 PM	Jessica:	Normal check 1124, payment 375..so we save almost another 100 pretax. After adding back the medical/dental we had going out, that’s almost 2700 more per month. Now if we can just get rid of kids 😜
	3:53 PM	Jessica:	He must have been dancing http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-killed-wife-aboard-cruise-ship-stop-laughing/story?id=48883288

	8:33 AM	Jessica:	make sure she eats her eggs I peeled for her and BRUSHES HER TEETH
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	Lots of girls there?
	9:06 AM	Jason:	Seemed so. Like a practice.
	9:07 AM	Jessica:	hopefully they do some fun things
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	can you plug in new budget numbers when you have time. Trying to see if I will have any budget to order a few things for clothes (some stuff is on sale). I would just put in the new 834. I know my paycheck is regular this time but I figure that extra few hundred will go towards, vent or motorcycle or savings stuff anyway. Noticed my pay in spreadsheet has been off 100. It had the number from my first paycheck that included an extra day. So it’s been 1124, not 1214
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	After August and all these extra things being taken care of. From the 2700 coming in from my work, I would like to start budgeting 700 for my business? I guess we can look at that in September.
	9:15 AM	Jason:	is the 36.18 that came out for vision going to be ongoing?
	9:16 AM	Jessica:	no
	9:16 AM	Jason:	oh, what was it for then?
	9:17 AM	Jessica:	that was to cover Kayla for a couple months so she could get her lenses and exams before leaving
	9:17 AM	Jason:	will it come out next month or was it just that once?
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	just that once
	9:18 AM	Jason:	our regular insurance doesn’t cover vision?
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	nope, no medical ever does, that’s always seperate. Even on the new stuff, we pay a seperate vision plan..$17
	9:20 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:21 AM	Jessica:	I drank my coffee to fast, my tummy isn’t happy
	9:21 AM	Jason:	uh oh
	9:21 AM	Jason:	i think budget is updated. i had missed backblaze because it’s only paid every two years so that made me mad. it’s the backup software for the computer.
	9:22 AM	Jessica:	well we need that!
	9:23 AM	Jason:	$700 for your biz sounds fine. we can put it savings start sep or you can make a new acct
	9:23 AM	Jessica:	we are getting there, things paying off, kids getting paid off....there is light at the end of the tunnel. That’s what I tell myself :)
	9:23 AM	Jason:	:)
	9:23 AM	Jason:	i marked two things in the budget red because they’ll be toba biz expenses when i register it as llc
	9:24 AM	Jason:	but they’re cheap
	9:24 AM	Jason:	that increases our distributions to $600 next time
	9:24 AM	Jason:	actually more when i stop the jeep tire allocation
	9:27 AM	Jason:	oops, my gaia checks have been less for a while. that’s odd. puts distro back to $500
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	sounds good on Toba. I’m sure at some point we will need to budget some for that as well.
	9:28 AM	Jason:	oh, it’s the 401(k), though i never explicitly signed up
	9:28 AM	Jason:	i guess that’s ok
	9:29 AM	Jason:	means we’ve been off like $500/mo between our two check discrepencies
	9:29 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, that’s worth it for the 401k, we wanted to get that going anyway..decision made 😂
	9:29 AM	Jessica:	well that explains a bit
	9:30 AM	Jessica:	you took at the medical and dental?
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	isn’t vehicle insurance monthly?
	9:34 AM	Jason:	i took out health insurance
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	yep, 145 monthly
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	take out dental too
	9:34 AM	Jason:	i don’t know when car insurance actually gets paid but i check the 6mo amt ocassionaly to see that it’s right
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	yep, it’s monthly at 144.92...just for accuracy ;)
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	that will drop quite a bit after this month when Kayla comes off
	9:39 AM	Jessica:	you can also remove Abbott reunion and Hunter registration. At least for this year
	9:39 AM	Jason:	you know you can type a “0” in the “per yr” column too :)
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	nope, I can’t
	9:40 AM	Jason:	joking or really can’t?
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	which is fine, I don’t want to mess anything up
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	erally can’t
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	really  can’t, just  tried
	9:41 AM	Jason:	it keeps infinite history so can always go back. should be able to edit now.
	9:41 AM	Jason:	always thought you could edit
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	first time I ever tried actually. It says comments only as my permision setting
	9:42 AM	Jason:	may have close and re-open or something
	9:43 AM	Jessica:	power for me 😁😬😅
	9:50 AM	Jessica:	I guess we’ll see in September if the 700 is feasible once the jeep tires are taken care of.
	9:50 AM	Jason:	should be fine
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	how’s the route planning/motorcycle fixing going?
	9:54 AM	Jason:	done with that for now
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Is it okay if I transfer 200 from billing to order my stuff while it’s on sale? Just deduct my distribution Monday?
	10:16 AM	Jason:	was meeting with andrew. go for it.
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	thanks :) messaging with our next Laura ;) she’s getting excited to come here.
	12:21 PM	Jason:	jeez, i need to write a letter

	3:34 PM	Jessica:	Brenna’s hair is rescheduled to next Wednesday. After I get home I have to grab my laptop and meet Sandra at Locovore to get Beer & Brats marketing materials ready. That way no weekend duties. I can just get another Lyft  ride, I have 50% off them right now so it was only $5
	3:35 PM	Jason:	nice. sounds good. both the lyft deal and the beer.
	3:35 PM	Jessica:	don’t forget the monster :)
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	Letters mailed. I did another sheet of questions and a sheet with funny quotes

	12:15 PM	Jason:	That was me

	8:32 AM	Jessica:	Girls to go home
	10:41 AM	Jason:	I’ll have a Hunter letter shortly
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:51 AM	Jessica:	Other dilemma, 22nd is Brenna’s first day of school
	11:13 AM	Jason:	what’s the dilemma?
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Eclipse camping
	11:18 AM	Jason:	Eye update yet?
	11:19 AM	Jessica:	Leaving now, antihistamine drops and a steroid drop
	11:21 AM	Jason:	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IH4HQ30x8eHtWLeJXjpqAmHzQAgi2G8H_Q3V4lxbZ0c/edit
	11:21 AM	Jason:	letter
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	would you remind Brenna that she needs to have the living room CLEAN and put back together BEFORE gymnastics..all food and dishes as well. I saw they got into taco stuff
	12:42 PM	Jason:	yeah, i’ve been on her to clean it
	12:42 PM	Jason:	prognosis?
	12:45 PM	Jessica:	unsure, she wants to to do the steroid drop to  calm it down and continue the antibiotic drops with an antihistamine drop in case allergies are making it worse. So basically throw a bit of everything in my eye :)
	12:46 PM	Jason:	good plan :)
	12:46 PM	Jessica:	oh goody, Hunter’s counselor wants me to call
	12:48 PM	Jason:	lemme know what’s up
	12:49 PM	Jason:	hopefully just something about shoelaces
	1:28 PM	Jason:	what was it about?
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	not sure, I had to leave her a message
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	when you have a few minutes can you put some pictures to send to walgreens that I can mail tomorrow, he wanted a variety. He can have multiple, just only 5 on him at a time
	1:47 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:13 PM	Jessica:	sounds like a boot issue again. The cadre called me, he found the boots, there was major miscommunication, it was decided they would let Hunter keep the first pair rather than me ordering, miscommunication about where the new ones were stored etc. So now they new ones are being sent back as he’s been wearing the first pair this whole time
	2:14 PM	Jason:	sheesh. well, that’s okay news, i guess
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	yeah, I’ll take it. He did read me a funny email about Hunter being excited to have two pairs...of course. He said he would inform him it was decided he did not need two and since he isn’t paying for them .... :)
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	oh, I do need to order gel inserts for him though
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Going to meet Zach over by Wings for a quick drink, let him tell me about his engagement proposal then stop by Heather’s before getting the girls. I haven’t seen the monsters in weeks and I probably won’t have time to this month with how my schedule is looking. Thank god I brought my flip flops

	9:42 AM	Jason:	Interesting article on screen time https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/
	10:03 AM	Jason:	I disabled Brenna’s computer time today but she doesn’t remember why she got in trouble and I didn’t hear it either
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	Vecause she continually takes everything from my bathroom without permission or returning. So when I get in I didn’t have my shampoo, I didn’t have my foot scrubbers etc. I am REALLY tired of not being able to have a single thing in the house that is mine, isn’t taken, destroyed or lost
	10:14 AM	Jason:	Understood. I’m sure you told her that. I’ll remind her.
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	I did. She also has been doing a very poor job of her chores but getting tons of computer time. Time to tighten that up and start getting back on limited screen schedule as school is around the corner
	10:19 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:20 AM	Jason:	2 hours a day is plenty. i’ll say no extra.

	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Ian
	1:18 PM	Jason:	Oh, wasn’t expecting that
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Dating a transgender girl
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Who identifies as a man
	1:19 PM	Jason:	Who is dramatic about it?
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Heather just messaged me about it, asking if I was sitting down
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	She forgot to tell me yesterday
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	I said I’m glad he’s that open-minded and if he’s happy good for him
	1:20 PM	Jason:	Exactly
	1:21 PM	Jason:	But I’ll keep an out for the “please pray for my mystery emergency” post ;)
	1:23 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

	11:31 AM	Jason:	So far good. Finishing letter to Hunter. Meant to last night but felt tired. You were able to send the last one before you left? Or should I print and send that too?

	11:40 AM	Jason:	what’s the plan today? brunch? naps?

	11:53 AM	Jason:	right mirror
	11:53 AM	Jessica:	Holy crap!
	11:53 AM	Jason:	part of plastic cowling around tank
	11:54 AM	Jessica:	And this was a successful ride?
	11:54 AM	Jason:	motorcycle kept running
	11:54 AM	Jason:	does give me slight worry that one of his wrecks will break something important and the ride will have to end
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Umm....yeah
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Maybe a bit more practice rides for him?
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Trails that aren’t to crazy for the brother ride?
	11:56 AM	Jason:	Nothing harder than we rode yesterday
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	Please don’t break him as his dad gets here!!
	11:56 AM	Jason:	Speeds are slow enough he’ll be fine
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	Just not the bike 😂
	12:40 PM	Jason:	i really don’t want to spend more money on the husky but it really needs a luggage rack to work. if it’s okay with you, i’ll transfer $200 (+tax/shipping) from credit line to get one ordered in time. I can’t find a cheaper one.
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	Works for me
	12:48 PM	Jessica:	Also, I did transfer 55 to take grandma to lunch
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	Trying to replace her kindle screen protector now and find her headphones
	12:54 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:09 PM	Jason:	I have a chore for you too. :) My tank bag zipper broke last fall when I rode with Tony. I priced a new bag. $189. Stupid zipper. I think Bucks Bags is near your work so maybe you could drop my bag there to get the zipper replaced.
	1:10 PM	Jason:	That’s why I didn’t bring my camera yesterday.
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	I can manage that 😉
	2:18 PM	Jason:	There are four work retreat options, for the weekend beginning Friday 9/8, 9/15, 10/27, 11/10 ... preference?
	2:48 PM	Jessica:	Preferably not 9/8
	2:51 PM	Jason:	Any others are fine?
	2:52 PM	Jessica:	Yep, Randi Kevin & family coming in October around Brenna bday
	2:54 PM	Jessica:	Old people like fox news
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Aaron picking up Brenna for gymnastics. Can you get them at 9? They are supposed to stay after to do a scrapbooking page for the two level 10’s headed to college
	3:10 PM	Jason:	Weird that they like Fox news since, at least on web page, articles are so shallow and prurient -- “You won’t believe! ...
	3:11 PM	Jason:	i can get them at 9
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	I keep seeing it in the clubhouse, grandma watches it too, but at least also the others
	9:19 PM	Jessica:	Late start, see you soon!
	9:22 PM	Jessica:	Heads up, I work early so will probably shower tonight and be as quiet as I can
	9:27 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Friday, September 15, 2017

	11:14 AM	Jessica:	I called wings to have them fix the billing for Brenna, they charged for 4 days a month and she isn’t starting that yet. They are also supposed to have the 175 credited to the competition payments so that it is not 300 this month, just not sure if they are doing it all as one payment or breaking it up over the 2. When you move the money back out of my account just leave 150 so I can pull Laura’s cash out
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	don’t let me forget to grab Hunter’s meds tonight
	11:39 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:39 AM	Jason:	what money am i moving back out of your account?
	11:54 AM	Jessica:	I am just assuming we will need to with recent expenses etc.
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	my paycheck is 150 shorter this time and next due to covering Kayla’s medical insurance for one month, now it’s dropped back off
	11:56 AM	Jason:	oh, i don’t think so, i’ll use the money still directed to savings for tires, i think. what we lose is getting your biz savings going for another cycle.
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	, that’s okay. I am working on some other things this month to wrap up anyway since I haven’t gotten crap done the last couple months of craziness. I can use my account for the small stuff
	11:59 AM	Jason:	i’ll move part of the unneeded savings depost back to billing, since it’s behind, and use the rest for dentist payment
	11:59 AM	Jason:	our portions can stay as is, i think
	1:17 PM	Jason:	we should go catch the mother movie
	1:17 PM	Jason:	i watched the preview
	1:17 PM	Jason:	christians are mad so now i’m intrigued
	1:18 PM	Jason:	fox news didn’t like it
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	yeah, looks interesting. What are the movie times? Rich is coming this way at 5 to meet for a drink at the Owyhee tavern. We could meet at the downtown theater or if you want to meet us at the tavern, whatever sounds good.
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	or we can go Sunday, I forgot we have girls staying the next two nights
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	hit the matinee
	1:38 PM	Jason:	oh yeah, gymnastics and sleepover
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	not sure yet if Laura will be there, can ask
	1:39 PM	Jason:	that’s true, maybe a babysitter
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez, downtown is only 6:15 or 9:15 tonight
	3:42 PM	Jessica:	holy crap it’s windy and a bit chilly out there
	3:42 PM	Jason:	i turned the heat on
	3:42 PM	Jason:	it smelled funny for a few minutes

	2:02 PM	Jason:	eh. all these job sites and “brand” companies ... all seems so fakey
	2:05 PM	Jason:	i’ve found i don’t even have to filter by IT. if i just put in my salary, IT jobs are the only things that show up.
	2:13 PM	Jessica:	that makes sense
	2:14 PM	Jessica:	anything interesting?
	2:14 PM	Jason:	nothing new
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	I am assumig you are only looking in Boise?

	3:01 PM	Jason:	gosh, i don’t see how its possible
	3:02 PM	Jessica:	I told her no, we need to be careful as we figure out everythig
	3:02 PM	Jessica:	she totally understood
	3:02 PM	Jason:	okay, good
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	this day seems long..maybe because it’s so dark
	3:15 PM	Jason:	that’s probably it. or maybe you’re a tad less busy?
	3:16 PM	Jessica:	no, busy..just not HOLY $#@! busy
	4:22 PM	Jason:	https://h30631.www3.hp.com/job/houston/it-cloud-development-architect/3544/5648277

	8:37 AM	Jason:	i’ll apply for this one https://jrsext.simplot.com/prodhcm/CandidateSelfService/controller.servlet?context.dataarea=prodhcm&webappname=CandidateSelfService&context.session.key.HROrganization=JRS&context.session.key.JobBoard=EXTERNAL2&_saveKeys=true&JobPost=2&JobReq=4425&context.session.key.noheader=true#
	8:37 AM	Jason:	what a terrible link
	8:46 AM	Jason:	oh, i don’t think that’s available anymore
	8:49 AM	Jason:	or maybe it is. they have a terrible career search system.
	8:50 AM	Jason:	tony is at simplot, right?
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	yep he is
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	When a position is in the interview stage or has been filled, it will no longer appear on our Simplot Careers website
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	must still be open
	9:03 AM	Jessica:	going to be funny if we end up working by each other 😁
	9:08 AM	Jason:	the search is broken, though, because if you click into the Boise positions, it doesn’t show, but if you zoom out to a kooky view of the world and click in Asia, you get a full list of positions that includes that one still
	9:08 AM	Jason:	i’d ask him but it’s 1:00 am in australia. i guess i’ll just apply.
	9:09 AM	Jason:	it’s live: http://www.toba.tech/
	9:10 AM	Jason:	my morning’s work
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	nice...and a bit funny
	9:18 AM	Jason:	oh my. their application software is even worse.
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	😂😂😂
	9:19 AM	Jason:	like their map-based job search, someone tried way too hard to make it fancy and utterly failed. maybe it worked well on their compjuter at one time.
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	looks like they need you ;)
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a GIF from Tenor GIF Keyboard.
	1:25 PM	Jason:	you need a secret heater under your desk
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	exactly
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	I’m starving

	10:12 AM	Jessica:	Kayla also put out an ad and she is about to take on work helping polish people with there english 😂
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	and Nick’s dad apologized, so that’s something
	10:13 AM	Jason:	that all sounds pretty good
	10:15 AM	Jason:	you must have sent a nice note :)
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	yeah, they have been excited about IKEA because it is good paying and would be evening weekends around his school schedule and for Kayla to practice english with people (her age mostly) $12-14 around her school schedule, that will definitely cover their living expenses
	10:16 AM	Jason:	that’s great
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	No, I behaved
	10:16 AM	Jason:	:)
	10:21 AM	Jessica:	I raced Tony to work

	10:31 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	I was going to share your post, but it doesn’t pull the actual content you added, just her meme.

	3:51 PM	Jessica:	ugh I know, I think I may delete the meme!
	3:51 PM	Jason:	i can repost without it, just the re: link
	3:52 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:53 PM	Jason:	phew
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	yeah, with as many ignorant dimwits posting..you know they wouldn’t read past the huge meme and understand it was not an endorsement of it.
	4:02 PM	Jason:	i typed your name and a different jessica abbott from northwestern mutual came up
	4:02 PM	Jason:	https://www.facebook.com/jessicazolp

	9:28 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	WE can’t “pause” the college account. We could reduce it by about $90 and or use the extra $110 sitting there to reduce the payment.
	10:48 AM	Jason:	what do you mean extra $110?
	10:54 AM	Jason:	you can tell me later. i know you’re busy :)
	10:54 AM	Jason:	i need to measure the back fo the jeep later to see which water heater might fit
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	I’m going out there at lunch to grab a jar, and I have a tape measure
	10:55 AM	Jason:	i’ll work on getting the one here detached over lunch
	10:56 AM	Jessica:	The 111 is just extra from account conversions or something, just sitting there in ISA account
	10:57 AM	Jessica:	I take it no info yet on the job apps.
	10:57 AM	Jason:	no
	10:58 AM	Jason:	i’ll check with iccu on mortgage forebearance
	11:09 AM	Jason:	you know how the hr processes are at big companies. the hiring manager may not even see the apps until it closes.
	11:09 AM	Jessica:	exactly
	11:10 AM	Jason:	i’ll make some follow-up contacts next week on apps i’ve sent
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	The amount available in the account is about $15,900. It can be drawn from or loaned upon at fixed 8%, just info to have as an option.
	11:11 AM	Jason:	okay, that’s enough for a couple months if needed
	11:12 AM	Jason:	more if i can get temporary mortgage payment reduction
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, that would buy us some time. If Hunter was already graduated I’d be all for the selling, having a smaller house and no debt idea..just saying... :)
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	What are the odds that you want to be my plus one for a Saturday evening gala at JUMP?
	11:16 AM	Jason:	Of course. Gala is my middle name.

	2:55 PM	Jason:	okay

	3:08 PM	Jessica:	nope, downtown..much closer. Payette Brewing on 13th and River St
	3:09 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	Laura about to send you the address to get picked up on the way, it’s just off Apple , I checked first before saying she could hang out with friends that it wasn’t far away

	8:27 AM	Jason:	the cards will be code named polywogs
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	polywogs 😂

	9:48 AM	Jason:	Thanks. Video interview after all so fixed hair.
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	good job
	10:09 AM	Jason:	hmm, no call yet
	10:10 AM	Jason:	there was a video invite on the calendar but i think stupid google may have automatically put that there
	10:14 AM	Jessica:	Hmmmm
	10:15 AM	Jason:	The recruiter lady has been impossible to reach the whole time. I left her a voice mail at 10:05.
	10:15 AM	Jason:	“Thanks Jason!
 
I’ve got you confirmed for a call this Thursday, the 19th @10am.
 
You’ll be speaking with Chris Johnson – VP of Information Technology. It’s possible that he will include one or two other managers within his team, but it depends on their availability.
 
I’ve attached a copy of the job posting for your reference.
 
Let me know if you have any questions, or if your availability changes at all.
 
Thanks!"
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	she seems a bit scattered
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	did she give you Chris’s info at all?
	10:18 AM	Jason:	no, i’m trying to look it up
	10:18 AM	Jason:	he looks 12
	10:19 AM	Jessica:	😂
	10:19 AM	Jessica:	I would try and call him direectly
	10:26 AM	Jason:	my e-mail to his assumed address bounced so i guess a call is next ...
	10:26 AM	Jason:	https://www.facebook.com/people/Chris-Johnson-Scentsy/100010907640692
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	yep..he looks young
	10:34 AM	Jason:	jeez, “0 ... sorry, operator isn’t available”
	10:35 AM	Jason:	finally got someone who also couldn’t reach chris or kayla or their assistants
	10:35 AM	Jason:	left voice mail for chris
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	well, that’s something.
	10:35 AM	Jason:	when i do get to talk, going to ask why they’re crazy and can’t answer phone ever
	10:36 AM	Jason:	you know me, i actually am going to ask that
	10:36 AM	Jason:	it tells me they’re disorganized or have too many meetings
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	Oh, I am sure you will. I do have to say the recruiter isn’t setting things up very well.
	10:50 AM	Jason:	she called. he was in a meeting that went long. she was offsite (same reason i heard last time i couldn’t reach her)
	10:50 AM	Jason:	oh well
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Rescheduled?
	11:36 AM	Jason:	he called me directly. we talked. i can tell you more about it later but nothing at all surprising.
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	seem interesting? Any feedback?
	11:39 AM	Jason:	well, not more or less interesting than i anticipated. managing 6-12 people who write code. helping them set goals, mentoring, the usual.
	11:44 AM	Jason:	i asked lots of questions about project management, task assignment, etc.
	11:44 AM	Jessica:	did they mention any next steps?
	11:44 AM	Jason:	oh, that they’ll be in touch next week after finishing more calls
	11:46 AM	Jessica:	how’s the portfolio coming along today?
	11:46 AM	Jason:	pretty well, apart from time wasted trying to get a call going. a couple more project summaries to write, then update portfolio page, then write applications for those jobs i found the othe rday
	11:47 AM	Jason:	filling in details for all these https://github.com/toba
	11:47 AM	Jason:	and these https://github.com/Jason-Abbott?tab=repositories
	11:47 AM	Jessica:	ummm, okay then
	11:48 AM	Jason:	e.g. https://github.com/Jason-Abbott/albertsons
	12:40 PM	Jason:	st. lukes financial called again
	12:44 PM	Jason:	fyi moved all my money to billing to cover jeep payment so can’t take any more from those accts
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	okay, I’'l call them again
	1:15 PM	Jason:	up to you. if you already have messages pending then probably just a disconnect on their end
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	well, I’m sure we’re in limbo waiting for Kaiser billing so it just stays in the queue and they call. But will check
	1:16 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	Had to run and meet Nancy for lunch, she called at 8 this morning wanting to meet for breakfast, having a bad day. I was not expecting to walk all the way down there so did NOT wear the right shoes..my feet are killing me
	1:17 PM	Jason:	just tell me when to get your bath run
	1:18 PM	Jason:	you need to keep a second pair there
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	I did over the summer have flip flops here, would have loved them today
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Kayla has a cold..which means she then got cold sores..she’s in homesick not feeling good want my mommy mode
	1:46 PM	Jason:	:(
	1:47 PM	Jason:	sounds like you should both crawl in the bath and video chat
	1:56 PM	Jessica:	she’s in bed now
	4:11 PM	Jason:	i’ll clean up the kitchen but haven’t made it down there yet :)
	4:13 PM	Jason:	this application has a lot of essays to write
	4:18 PM	Jason:	there are seven essay questions and they say they read all the applicant answers to the same question together, so each answer must stand out on its own
	4:18 PM	Jason:	i was thinking of haikus
	4:25 PM	Jason:	now i’m pacing a lot
	4:29 PM	Jessica:	of course you are

Friday, October 20, 2017

	9:04 AM	Jessica:	Project for you today, find: I realize I’ll probably be asleep by the time you get home but upstairs in one of the boxes should be a bunch of school stuff like notebooks and stuff: I need the purple one that says Pennie seibert psych 101 and then a writing notebook that has statistics notes in it (i think it’s a blue bsu notebook)
	9:05 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:05 AM	Jason:	first i need to get these applications done. hopefully no more than 4-6 hours of work.
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	yucky

	9:06 AM	Jason:	:(

	9:07 AM	Jessica:	only if I put my face in the icecream
	9:49 AM	Jason:	any feedback on my first answer? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTVKyucQvXMDoY0xNvciCGI7Y_8cxsPMfLWRv5fbkFs/edit#heading=h.5ddrkp3v7vw7

	10:05 AM	Jason:	you can call out my lies too ;)
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	answer under how many people you managed, what were your responsibilities?
	10:06 AM	Jason:	i’ve only answered the first question
	10:07 AM	Jason:	but yeah, i just added notes there to remind myself of that part of the question
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	It looks good to  me!
	10:10 AM	Jason:	thank you. i’ll share again when i get the rest written. i think the first will be the longest answer.
	10:19 AM	Jason:	feeling any better?
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	just feel really hot
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	not bad, a bit tired
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	doesn’t look like Hunter ranked up again
	10:33 AM	Jason:	hmm. glad he seems to be positive about the whole experience but the rank up thing is starting to seem like the “yeah i got that homework done” :)
	10:33 AM	Jason:	a lot more important that he gets the work done and regards it as a good experience than arbitrary rank-ups
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	agreed, but yeah the “yeah I did that” attitude when hasn’t bugs me.
	10:35 AM	Jason:	yeah, might be good to impress on him the important of being direct, honest
	10:35 AM	Jason:	future bosses won’t like the b.s.
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:39 AM	Jason:	any updates from kayla?

	10:53 AM	Jason:	now maybe brunch beer?
	10:54 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:54 AM	Jason:	(i thumbed-up myself)
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	12:42 PM	Jason:	finished that app. two more to do but that was the longest, i think
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	Holy crap!!
	12:43 PM	Jason:	this is a full time job
	12:43 PM	Jason:	pay kinda sucks
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.

	8:56 AM	Jessica:	Home in a few

Monday, October 23, 2017

	9:01 AM	Jason:	Girls had a case of the Mondays
	9:02 AM	Jessica:	of course they did
	9:04 AM	Jason:	i’ll get cakes and hunters meds shortly, send to meds to school (c/o ?), vacuum
	9:04 AM	Jason:	any other $ needed for party?
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	IDYCA 117 Timberline Dr, Pierce, ID 83546
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	Thomas-Axe c/o Sissy Morris
	9:16 AM	Jessica:	Send out Kayla’s package, just open the other box and put the shake mixes and everything in the other box. Should fit
	9:16 AM	Jessica:	The address is:
Marii Kazimiery 18/153
Warsaw, Poland 01-641
	9:17 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	caught up on sleep?
	9:36 AM	Jason:	i think so. you?
	9:38 AM	Jessica:	for the moment
	10:14 AM	Jason:	no other $ needed for party?
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	Not that I can think of
	10:43 AM	Jason:	dong exercises. should seems a lot better.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	*shoulder
	10:57 AM	Jessica:	That’s good
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	hows the applications etc? Call sketch-deck (is that right?)
	11:28 AM	Jason:	that call is wed
	11:28 AM	Jason:	going alright. shower soon.
	12:24 PM	Jason:	an hour to vacuum. now shower time then shopping.
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:57 PM	Jason:	how much is hunters rx usually?
	12:57 PM	Jessica:	60
	12:59 PM	Jason:	ok, we won’t have enough for the jeep payment the month
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	So what are possible solutions
	1:06 PM	Jason:	just let it be late, i think
	1:06 PM	Jason:	take the credit rating hit
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	Can we pull from savings?
	1:07 PM	Jason:	no, that’s what i meant above, i just pulled everything i could from savings to cover rx, cake, shipping
	1:08 PM	Jason:	all that’s left in there is the next reduced paycheck amount and enough to cover the planned expenses that come out of there
	1:10 PM	Jessica:	Would it make more sense to pull and cover expenses now, knowing that if we need we can pull from the savings here if needed? Have you called ICCU regarding the mortgage?
	1:10 PM	Jason:	no, what i read about mortgage forebearance is they won’t consider it unless you can show you’re already drawing unemployment
	1:10 PM	Jason:	which i can’t do until after the first week of november
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	gotcha
	1:13 PM	Jason:	dang, reminds me i forgot to put money on brenna’s lunch acct
	1:14 PM	Jason:	there’s still garbage bill to come out, about $148 this month, so jeep can just wait a week
	1:14 PM	Jason:	and i’ll reduce our distributions
	1:16 PM	Jason:	have you shipped anything to poland? know how much that will be?
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	Do I need to initiate from savings on this side? Won’t Jeep just automatically pull what is can to zero?
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	No, I haven’t Kayla said USPS the cheapest
	1:17 PM	Jason:	yep, so will just pull a few dollars since that’s all that will remain
	1:18 PM	Jason:	k, i’ll pull up a price estimator for usps
	1:24 PM	Jason:	looks like maybe $80 to ship
	1:24 PM	Jason:	can it wait a week
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	no, she really needs it. Shouldn’t be that much...80 I mean.
	1:26 PM	Jason:	https://postcalc.usps.com/Calculator/MailServices?country=10357&ccode=PL&omil=False&dmil=False&mdt=10%2F23%2F2017&mdz=13%3A29&m=12&dvi=0

	1:28 PM	Jason:	perfect, really, so it won’t shake around
	1:29 PM	Jason:	went the other route for custom box, using dimensions of amz box = $82

	10:35 AM	Jason:	(yes, back doing this while Brenna slowly, if at all, works on her room)
	10:38 AM	Jason:	Solving their puzzles, having great experience and writing elegant cover letters is obviously not enough (still getting rejected) so I’m making a special animated landing page for my Balihoo resume. They said they love animation.

I’m not sure how else to do better.
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	I think your doing fine. It’s just how the process goes.

	12:41 PM	Jason:	we’re pulling out principal and surrendering earnings
	12:43 PM	Jason:	i have no checks so i guess the payment has to be mailed anyway
	12:44 PM	Jason:	hmm, it won’t let me continue without attaching a voided check so i guess just do the mailing option
	12:44 PM	Jason:	i thought i could at least sign it
	12:50 PM	Jessica:	I’ll email Lauren when back at my desk
	12:50 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Friday, November 3, 2017

	9:21 AM	Jason:	Sorry to bring this up again but should I just pay that St. Luke’s bill? The notices are getting more demanding.
	10:29 AM	Jessica:	does it show anything paid on it? What is the amount?
	10:37 AM	Jason:	I didn’t log into check (was raking leaves). Just a sec ...
	10:38 AM	Jason:	these:
	10:38 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	okay, calling now
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	sent you an email
	10:39 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	Kaiser was illed, they only paid 39.38 on the 204 one and the rest towards deductuble. Same with the 80, all towards deductible. So basically stuck with it unless I battle with Scott over paying a portion..which I don’t see happening. She did say if you are logged in on the home tab you can create a finance plan and do minimum $25 payments.. Take a look and decide, may be a good idea for this month while things are tight. Then pay off later
	10:51 AM	Jason:	Thanks for sorting that. I know it’s been a pain. I’ll make the money arrangements.
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	no problem, sorry I didn’t get to it sooner. What was really irritating is I found all that billing happened May 3rd, so as she informed me the lady I talked to last time was totally wrong about Kaiser not being billed so it was never sent through. Calling select health now to see if they will cover the 3d mammogram or if I need to do the digital so we don’t get a bill
	10:56 AM	Jason:	stupid insurance
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	agreed
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	gymnastics covered, Brenna needs to be ready at 3:25 and bring Mya’s sweatshirt
	11:03 AM	Jason:	oh awesome. thanks. that will be a little nicer to prep for the interview.
	11:06 AM	Jessica:	no problem. also yep the 3d one is covered..phew
	11:06 AM	Jason:	nice
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	oh...also from Jess Rasmussen:
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	Hello!! Hope all is well with you guys on the other side of town. I am a doof and just realized (yes almost 2 years after the fact) that I never actually downloaded all of the wedding pictures that Jason edited for us. He put them on a dropbox file and now it says it doesn’t exist anymore. Would it be possible for him to send those to me or put up on another site so I can download all of them 🙂 Pretty please and thank you!
	11:08 AM	Jason:	that’s funny. i think i deleted those just recently to make room for some other shared photos. they were out there for a heck of a long time. but yeah, of course i still have them all and will re-export.
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I teased her. No rush for today, maybe this weekend if you have time
	11:15 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	If one more person has a pizza or jimmy johns delivery to the front desk I may hurt them!
	11:55 AM	Jason:	making you hungry? or just a hassle?
	11:56 AM	Jason:	data enter three things, lose your place accepting the delivery ... :(
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	both
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	what was the data thing?
	11:57 AM	Jason:	i was imagining your perspective
	11:57 AM	Jason:	it made sense in my head
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	oh gotcha
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	she’s asking for screen time. AM I leaving it to you?
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	am
	12:28 PM	Jason:	yes
	12:28 PM	Jason:	just went and checked her room
	12:29 PM	Jason:	she has to clean one drawer then she’ll get some limited time, etc.
	12:29 PM	Jason:	if you don’t disagree
	12:29 PM	Jessica:	I’m fine with that
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	can you tell Brenna to turn on her gizmo, I’m trying to update it
	1:27 PM	Jason:	she’s on her way to her room to do it
	1:27 PM	Jason:	she says it’s on
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	thanks
	1:32 PM	Jason:	do you have to do any prep for the mammogram?
	1:37 PM	Jessica:	Take of my deodorant. Weird huh?
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	I guess it takes longer because of the implants
	1:38 PM	Jason:	that is weird (deodorant)
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	right?
	1:44 PM	Jason:	maybe put on heavy perfume instead. see if they like that.
	2:21 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	2:22 PM	Jason:	looking for mark’s address. i probably have it in e-mail somewhere. i never remember exactly where his place is. maybe i can just drop laura in the general area.
	2:26 PM	Jason:	got it
	2:26 PM	Jason:	halloween invite
	2:26 PM	Jessica:	Will send in a few
	2:26 PM	Jason:	too slow. i got it. :)
	2:32 PM	Jason:	Good luck (right word?) with the procedure! :)
	2:46 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	3:31 PM	Jason:	Laura dropped off, Brenna just left, next stop job interview. Let me know how the procedure was, when you’re up to it.
	3:49 PM	Jason:	Saw your e-mail. I need to focus a bit on interview prep before I can answer ...
	3:51 PM	Jessica:	Just done, the prep takes longer than the testing. That was..um well, odd. No worries, focus. You got this, they are already impressed by your application, you have more than enough qualifications
	3:52 PM	Jason:	Discomfort must have been bearable
	3:52 PM	Jessica:	Yeah not bad, just very squished numerous ways
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	Ugh, trying to track down 2011 images
	3:58 PM	Jason:	of what? breasts?
	3:58 PM	Jessica:	Yep, they need those to compare to before they do results
	3:59 PM	Jason:	I’m pretty sure I don’t have any
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	No, just trying to figure out where they were done to get them sent over
	4:00 PM	Jason:	One of my job applications is about that --- medical imaging
	4:00 PM	Jason:	The one I need to write some test code for, actually
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	Calls being made. Go focus on your interview. Tell me about it later.
	4:01 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:01 PM	Jason:	Reading their blog, testing their code, etc.
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	Oh..Hunter got academic excellence award!!!😂😂😂❤
	4:02 PM	Jason:	Wow, that’s awesome. I hope he calls so we can congratulate.
	4:02 PM	Jason:	And yes, kind of funny.
	4:07 PM	Jason:	I shaved and started a fire behind me so all I should have to do is smile now
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	Like that?
	4:13 PM	Jason:	Exactly 😕
	5:54 PM	Jason:	All done. I think it went well. Very nice guy.
	5:54 PM	Jason:	Will get feedback next week.
	5:56 PM	Jason:	Mentioned 130K “well within range”
	6:21 PM	Jason:	Ping me if you think of it when you’re on your way and I’ll open the garage
	6:36 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	6:43 PM	Jessica:	Go well?
	6:44 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I think so. Did you see my quick messages above? (Damn phone people) :P
	6:46 PM	Jessica:	Missed it until now, I’ll get details from you soon ;)
	8:34 PM	Jessica:	Houston, landing in 5 😂
	8:34 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	9:57 AM	Jason:	Oh crap, they’re at the end of our driveway now. Shhhhh.
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:29 AM	Jason:	On the tarmac? Did Kevin catch up?

	11:30 AM	Jason:	Got guinea pig and Laura food (milk and cereal) here.

	3:11 PM	Jason:	Interview seemed to go well. Everything coming together over there?
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	Just got here. Details on the interview?
	3:38 PM	Jason:	Mostly non-technical, friendly group, seemed a lot more down-to-earth than TSheets, mostly time spent laughing, two ladies had experience at Albertsons and St. Lukes.
	3:39 PM	Jason:	Kevin with you?
	3:40 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	3:40 PM	Jason:	Yea
	3:41 PM	Jason:	Time for me to drive girls
	5:45 PM	Jason:	Apparently it’s kitty-attacks-feet time
	5:51 PM	Jessica:	😆

	5:52 PM	Jason:	That’s good :)

	6:07 PM	Jason:	Zapier interview is Friday 12:45
	6:09 PM	Jessica:	Kev broke his jeep...I’m teasing him

	6:54 PM	Jason:	https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/45913489/family?cfpid=6444921782
	6:56 PM	Jason:	things are out-of-date there but can’t update without paying

Friday, November 10, 2017

	12:11 AM	Jason:	Can’t sleep. Feel anxious. Hope you’re deep in dreams. Warm light. Beautiful garden. All that.
	5:26 AM	Jessica:	Oh no, I  hope you got more sleep
	7:27 AM	Jessica:	Why anxious?
	7:54 AM	Jason:	Shouldn’t have mentioned that. Keep all your energies there. Though do need to say I researched counselors and she sounded good (probably just a higher Google result): http://www.meganlinzcounseling.com/
	7:55 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:56 AM	Jessica:	Didn’t answer my question....
	7:56 AM	Jessica:	Pretty
	8:02 AM	Jason:	Just thinking of us. But really, keep your focus there. We’re having international dance-offs and a cat circus here.

I’ll schedule something with Linz if she seems alright.
	8:05 AM	Jessica:	She seems fine, go ahead. When is zapier today?
	8:05 AM	Jason:	12:45
	8:06 AM	Jason:	Elation Health at 11
	8:06 AM	Jessica:	Busy day for you
	8:06 AM	Jason:	Yeah. And clear sky is my signal to refill the newly emptied compost bin.
	8:07 AM	Jason:	What are your plans today?
	8:12 AM	Jason:	UPS says there’s a “Venus” package coming in a week. I hope its related to NASA.
	8:17 AM	Jessica:	Kevin just left,  I’m watching Ben who is potty training so just cleaned poopy underwear
	8:18 AM	Jessica:	Yeah used my venus credit
	8:19 AM	Jason:	Too bad it couldn’t be used to clean poopy underwear. You think Kevin’s visit went the way he hoped? (hope? hard to know the right word)
	8:20 AM	Jessica:	Call me
	8:49 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:49 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	8:51 AM	Jason:	Wow, forgot the look of clear glass
	8:51 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:52 AM	Jessica:	😂😂
	9:58 AM	Jason:	I think Nibbles is depressed. She’s been sulking.
	10:09 AM	Jessica:	Did you get her food?
	10:10 AM	Jason:	Yeah, day after you departed. I think she’s just mellow during the day. She was feisty last night.
	10:11 AM	Jason:	Trying to remember names of all hospital software I interacted with ...
	10:12 AM	Jessica:	That sounds..ummm
	10:13 AM	Jason:	Interviewing with Madina https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ywKEUkB4FnMPxv_MaFk-gcUhcBmlUCU-V6GNw83-WY/edit
	10:14 AM	Jason:	Those are my notes
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	You’re very prepared
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	I win
	10:18 AM	Jason:	Well done :)
	10:24 AM	Jason:	You see the e-mail about Laura’s absences? I figured they were excused if we were contacted and acknowledged them. I can reply but want to be sure I’m not missing something.
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, just reply
	10:25 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:27 AM	Jason:	k, just need to find a couple other items for my notes, then i’ll reply
	11:26 AM	Jason:	Call seemed to go great. Wasn’t technical.
	11:26 AM	Jason:	Now finishing notes for Zapier in an hour.
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	Nice...any details?
	11:27 AM	Jason:	See my notes!
	11:27 AM	Jason:	Ha, just kidding
	11:28 AM	Jason:	They’re an EHR, sort of the CRM of healthcare, but with a focus on physician experience, which I totally get. Doctors hate the usual EHRs that require a bunch of data entry.
	11:29 AM	Jason:	Next step would be hour long tech interview followed by in-person.
	11:30 AM	Jason:	San Francisco
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	Where are they based?
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	😂
	11:30 AM	Jason:	They have about 50 staff, 11 programmers, 4 other that are remote
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	Nice.
	11:30 AM	Jason:	She likes that I already have remote expeirence
	11:30 AM	Jason:	cat was playing with my feet during call
	11:30 AM	Jason:	told her about it
	11:31 AM	Jason:	Teased her about using her psych degree to make screening calls
	11:31 AM	Jason:	Usual inappropriate stuff that’s funny in my head
	11:32 AM	Jessica:	Oh boy
	11:33 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:34 AM	Jason:	Noise maker
	11:34 AM	Jason:	“who me?"
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:37 AM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	11:37 AM	Jason:	Endless
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	She’s entertained
	11:51 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:51 AM	Jason:	Cat blog
	12:05 PM	Jason:	zapier notes so far https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQU5wcB9EVrL-Ok0rKCmT77VG5QpbxI2QBf1hjlrK84/edit
	12:08 PM	Jessica:	You’re ready
	1:32 PM	Jason:	All done. Seemed really good. A little harder to tell, though, since questions were all about management, so no exact right answer. More issues of style. But I felt we connected.
	1:36 PM	Jason:	And they could see the kitten playing behind me. I’m sure that helped.
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	Of course the kitten helped!
	1:43 PM	Jason:	:)
	1:43 PM	Jason:	They said they should be in touch early next week.
	1:47 PM	Jessica:	That’s promising..having a timeline is helpful
	1:47 PM	Jason:	Yeah, they’ve been really good about that
	1:48 PM	Jason:	What are you up to now? I assume you’re done babysitting. :)
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	Yep, Aaron home. Studying until Ingrid is home
	1:55 PM	Jason:	[ whip sound ]
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	Funny
	2:01 PM	Jason:	Shall I tell Linz (e-mail) that 12:00 is better than 1:00 next Thursday?
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	Sounds good
	2:14 PM	Jason:	Sorry to interrupt your studying ... I have two selecthealth cards from you, one with red stripe and “preference,” the other green stripe. Do you know which I should send Linz?
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	2:17 PM	Jessica:	Haha, not sure why upside down
	2:18 PM	Jason:	oh good, that one has better benefits. thanks.

off the hook for kid rids today. Robin wants to drive both ways.
	2:18 PM	Jason:	*rides
	2:20 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	3:39 PM	Jason:	Kount wants another interview
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	See...in demand. No worries.
	4:01 PM	Jason:	Next Fri at 1:00
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	What did you think of that one?
	4:06 PM	Jason:	It was very easy going. People were friendly. Didn’t seem like fake happiness at TSheets.
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Still studying?
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	Haha..no Ben didn’t like that, he took my book
	4:11 PM	Jason:	maybe he’ll take the test too
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	The way my brain is working...he probably would do better
	4:15 PM	Jason:	😄
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	He’s taking pics
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Masterpiece
	4:16 PM	Jason:	art
	4:27 PM	Jessica:	Also, I added Mandy back in fb
	4:28 PM	Jason:	Oh, what prompted that?
	4:28 PM	Jessica:	Ingrid made me
	4:28 PM	Jason:	Sisters
	4:29 PM	Jason:	Did she make you with a reason or just said you had to?
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	Just ...it’s your sister..I agree what she did is shitty..but fix it
	4:31 PM	Jason:	No nonsense
	4:31 PM	Jason:	Like someone else I know
	4:31 PM	Jessica:	Shut up
	4:32 PM	Jason:	😜
	5:56 PM	Jason:	Rain, rain. Did you see neighbor Patti’s recent post?
	5:58 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	5:58 PM	Jason:	Well, now you’ll look, so ...
	5:59 PM	Jason:	Get the all clear on your mammy gram? Or they still matching images?
	6:00 PM	Jessica:	Omg..that’s scary
	6:01 PM	Jason:	Yeah, no idea. Tony talked about riding tomorrow but I’m sure that’s off. Besides ... rain.
	6:01 PM	Jessica:	No word yet, intermountain sent the 2011 images over today, so next week results. I’m sure it’s fine, I’m not worried
	6:01 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Jeez, kitty is another Brenna, crying when I don’t give her what she wants. Okay, okay, I’ll play with you again.
	7:31 PM	Jessica:	I do appreciate the poems. I just don’t think I emotionally can respond very well right now. I’m not quite sure how to. I just wanted you to know I received them and appreciate them.
	7:33 PM	Jason:	No response needed. :) I’m glad to know you received them, that’s all. Your mind will process at the right pace. It’s face with lots.
	7:33 PM	Jason:	*faced
	7:33 PM	Jason:	Trying to choose poems that will be helpful, inspiring, or something that doesn’t rub the wrong way
	7:35 PM	Jason:	This haiku hasn’t worked yet but i’ll share anyway ;)
	7:35 PM	Jason:	Squeeze of lemon
Smell the sea
A taunt for Heather
	7:37 PM	Jessica:	That’s a perfect example of not wanting to say anything with her. I feel like I am obviously going to be judged, I don’t get an opinion or my thoughts are abusive..so I have no comment. I just need to word everything perfectly or I will pay for it. I’m sorry if that bothers you, but that’s where I am after this last week
	7:41 PM	Jason:	Sorry, I think I understand that but my brain isn’t parsing the first sentence -- “anything with her”?
	7:42 PM	Jessica:	Brenna being mad
	7:42 PM	Jessica:	The kitty Brenna comparison
	7:42 PM	Jason:	Ah
	7:47 PM	Jason:	Oh Jess, as much as I’d like to talk through that, because it’s not how I want you to feel, not what I mean to convey, I don’t want to add to your burdens. Your time there is limited. I want you to be as present there as you need to be.
	8:15 PM	Jessica:	I’m not trying to argue with you,just wanted to be honest in how I’m feeling
	8:17 PM	Jason:	I appreciate that. I didn’t take it as arguing. 😉
	8:19 PM	Jason:	When I thought talking might “add to your burdens,” I didn’t mean because it would be argumentative ... just a distraction from events there. I’m happy to talk. Or read you some Billy Collins.
	8:55 PM	Jessica:	No, I’m just super sensi3at this point. Ingrid and Aaron dealt with some “Ben issues” today and even though normal to me..I realized you would have gone a different way with it if it was me..didn’t make feel ok.
	8:55 PM	Jessica:	Sensitive
	9:45 PM	Jason:	I understand. Truly. I end up obsessing about my behaviors when you’ve called me out. But try not to be on edge. Like you, I just want to point out those things that can really be made better – not to begrudge but to build.

Because that really *is* the goal, I would merely try to follow what a hundred online organizations and studies say: do not insult or criticize children. Full stop. I know I fail in that regard. I’m grateful when you point it out. I really want to be kinder.
	9:59 PM	Jason:	P.S. I’ve always admired the thing you tell the kids in this regard: “it’s okay to be angry, not okay to be mean.” Of course the kids will make us angry (those turds) but I bet we can both do more to be kind and not mean when we hold them accountable. :)

	12:39 PM	Jessica:	Now you know why I didn’t do it often..I have to practice
	12:46 PM	Jason:	I’m totally going to add this skill to my LinkedIn profile
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	Obviously you should
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	I just met lots of uncles and family..so strange.
	5:07 PM	Jason:	Wow. Happy you get to have that experience even though occasion is hard. See any resemblences?
	5:07 PM	Jason:	Told Brenna she needed to shower after previous, earlier message, while I went to clean the yard. Just now done in yard. Tired. Making salad and spaghetti.
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	I just want to cry right now
	5:10 PM	Jason:	Why? Something begun and ended too quickly? Obvious reasons, I guess :(

	7:36 AM	Jessica:	I want to still be asleep, lounging
	7:47 AM	Jason:	Btw: “too damn” 😇

	10:37 AM	Jason:	Yikes

	10:42 AM	Jason:	I’m hearing you say you’re all staying at Carin’s today ;)
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	No, back at Ingrids now
	10:43 AM	Jason:	I didn’t think there was a house harder to reach than Isabel’s but Laura found one. Google says I have an hour drive (there and back).
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	What???
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	Yikes
	10:45 AM	Jason:	Far end of McMillan, either go Chinden or Interstate, but then still have to go a long way on surface streets. I’ll need some Rootbeer licquer.

	12:02 PM	Jason:	Maybe unemployment check in there.
	12:09 PM	Jason:	No check. Checked online again and now it says payment will be deposited tomorrow.
	12:09 PM	Jason:	Nice walk?
	12:11 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:11 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:12 PM	Jason:	😍
	12:12 PM	Jason:	(I’m a little embarassed to use that emoji but do love the scene)
	12:13 PM	Jessica:	Going to take a little nap
	12:13 PM	Jason:	Perfect day ;) I hope you sleep well.
	12:15 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:15 PM	Jason:	Cleaned
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	4:03 PM	Jason:	Carefully framed to hide the leaves still in the backyard. :) One more round of bin emptying ...
	4:03 PM	Jason:	Front of house is all clean
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	Haha, good job
	4:05 PM	Jason:	A little recuperating today? The beach looked peaceful.
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, just ate dinner
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	Beach was nice, sun was out so not toooooooo cold
	4:07 PM	Jason:	Planning to take the girls out for dinner somewhere, if you think the expense is okay. Then maybe more evening french braid practice. See if we can get it done for school tomorrow.

	4:12 PM	Jessica:	How’s the kitten?
	4:12 PM	Jason:	Oh, sorry, haven’t kept the blog up ;)
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	You switched to poems
	4:13 PM	Jason:	Same as ever. Brenna has to cuddle her every night. It distresses her a lot to hear the kitten outside the door.
	4:13 PM	Jason:	But I can’t sleep when the kitten is clawing around the bed and biting my head.
	4:13 PM	Jason:	Which she does.
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, that would be annoying. Brenna could sleep in her bed😂
	4:15 PM	Jason:	Funny, I know, but Brenna really stressed the first night over whether to sleep in our bed or with the kitten. You know ... we’re just barely more important than a cat.
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	I’m actually surprised the cat didn’t win that battle
	4:17 PM	Jason:	Me too
	4:49 PM	Jason:	I’m kind of worried about this: how are your flashy nails holding up?
	5:01 PM	Jessica:	Very funny, they are good

	7:42 PM	Jason:	Must be excited for Thanksgiving
	7:42 PM	Jason:	Oh, that’s awesome
	7:43 PM	Jason:	Obviously performed well
	7:43 PM	Jason:	Who did he call last week?
	7:44 PM	Jessica:	YES, very. Sounds like Scott and his mom are coming to graduation and he will go there until the 30th
	7:45 PM	Jason:	That’s great
	7:45 PM	Jason:	I’m sure he’s feeling good about that
	7:46 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	7:47 PM	Jason:	I just showed the girls his food list while we were waiting for our food
	7:48 PM	Jason:	They were impressed

	5:35 AM	Jessica:	Did you or Brenna use the iPad to sign into my Google accounts?
	6:42 AM	Jason:	I found Brenna had been playing on the tablet all evening, accounting for the blanket and pillow nest she made in the corner of the living room
	6:43 AM	Jessica:	On your iPad? Little brat.
	6:50 AM	Jason:	Was watching one of *my* movie choices which somehow ended up being really weird so she got bored. Sheesh.
	6:51 AM	Jason:	Sleep alright?
	6:56 AM	Jessica:	O.k., not feeling great

	11:46 AM	Jessica:	That’s fine with me
	11:49 AM	Jason:	K, obviously can switch back if it doesn’t work for some reason. Just easier to do while cleaning.

	1:24 PM	Jason:	*sick
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	Thanks, did you respond to email from school?
	1:25 PM	Jason:	No, I did e-mail to let them know Laura was out but didn’t respond to the one we received yet.
	1:26 PM	Jason:	What would you say? I think just that I can help her catch up on anything? I haven’t logged in to see if she’s actually missing work.

	3:09 PM	Jason:	It didn’t quite feel successful. Second group was nice. That seemed good. First group had questions I couldn’t fully answer, like network security stuff. None of what I was told to study came up. They even seemed mildly rude at a few points but I may have been reading into it. I did my best.
	3:10 PM	Jason:	I was calm, friendly, articulate, all that.
	3:13 PM	Jessica:	Sounds a bit frustrating
	3:15 PM	Jason:	Yeah. And disheartening. Feel less sure of it now than I did of TSheets and Zapier. I think time to hit the applications hard again.

	3:23 PM	Jessica:	I can get them tonight and grab it too
	3:24 PM	Jason:	was your “sure” yesterday to seeing the uke thing tonight, though?
	3:24 PM	Jason:	if so, we’d go straight from there together, i figured
	3:24 PM	Jason:	but if i misunderstood, okay too
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	oh I totally forgot about that

	4:12 PM	Jessica:	I think I asked but my brain is rather fried lately, the van rental got done right?
	4:13 PM	Jason:	Yes
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	4:23 PM	Jessica:	did you notice that ukele thing doesn’t start until 7?
	4:23 PM	Jason:	I did. We won’t see it all. Maybe best 😀
	4:28 PM	Jason:	I was the the thinking go 6ish

	2:56 PM	Jason:	i was serious about the poetry/wine event, btw
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	I am so sick of furniture shopping, I never thought I would say that
	2:56 PM	Jason:	it’s very easy to empathize since i would have been sick of it immediately
	2:56 PM	Jason:	i think you should send them joke selections similar to the yellow desk idea
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	good idea
	2:57 PM	Jason:	lava lamps, bean bags
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	the bean bag joke is already happening

Thursday, November 30, 2017

	7:45 AM	Jessica:	Sunrise
	8:01 AM	Jason:	Nice pink one :)
	8:07 AM	Jessica:	t was really cool driving in..sky was purple everywhere
	8:08 AM	Jason:	I’m jealous. I just saw the bit of pink while I was out in the driveway.
	8:08 AM	Jason:	No picture?
	8:09 AM	Jessica:	I couldn’t get a good one :9
	8:09 AM	Jessica:	;(
	8:09 AM	Jessica:	damn it
	8:20 AM	Jason:	Brenna made herself exactly the things I’d offered to make her: brown sugar oatmeal and toast.
	8:22 AM	Jason:	Looking more closely at Cy’s site
	8:26 AM	Jessica:	That’s funny, little moody monster
	8:26 AM	Jessica:	Any thoughts on his site other than what we discussed?
	8:26 AM	Jason:	I kind of doubt site performance is enough to affect business but probably worth correcting
	8:26 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:27 AM	Jason:	That’s a Google tool called PageSpeed Insights https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=www.cygilbertphotography.com%2Fromance&tab=mobile
	8:27 AM	Jason:	I’ll make some other comments as I’m looking ...
	8:29 AM	Jessica:	Thanks!
	8:30 AM	Jessica:	You should be receiving an email shortly for the e-signature to deposit the $13,611
	8:30 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:32 AM	Jason:	Looking more closely, not sure those performance ideas are the most helpful thing to mention. Many are out of his control unless he’s a a bit techy.
	8:33 AM	Jason:	I’ll check SEO next
	8:33 AM	Jessica:	sounds good
	8:34 AM	Jason:	If he’s paid someone to setup his site then I would definitely send them that same link and say they should improve
	8:36 AM	Jason:	Brenna is showing me how she learned to play chess
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	you need a chess partner
	8:41 AM	Jason:	doc signed and returned
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	good job, bring the brat to school
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	pinch her for me
	8:42 AM	Jason:	For the Cy site, I can give a lot of technical feedback on why performance is poor. I’m not qualified to remark on images. I have different taste for some but what I know of lighting, composition, they look good.
	8:42 AM	Jason:	I will pinch her
	8:43 AM	Jessica:	:)
	8:43 AM	Jason:	I notice his nature shots mix distant mountain/lake scenes with close-up details of plants and such, which is also my (and I think your) taste. I wonder if he should do some of the same for real estate? Or like I said last night, maybe he does and it’s just not on the site. It seems to add flavor, at least to me. Your opinion is just as valid as mine on the matter. Maybe it isn’t important.
	8:44 AM	Jason:	Driving. Laura is up now.
	8:59 AM	Jason:	It was a snooze button snafu.
	9:02 AM	Jason:	I’ll let you catch up on those then I have a question ...
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	what’s the question?
	9:09 AM	Jason:	I had DreamHost in the budget for $31 in March each year. Do I need to change it to $50 in Nov or are there two separate ones?
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	sorry, people came to my desk
	9:25 AM	Jason:	no worries :) it happens when you have a job
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	it’s 10 a month, so that was a few months worth
	9:26 AM	Jason:	ah, okay. does it bill quarterly usually, or monthly? just want to put the right times in there
	9:26 AM	Jessica:	monthly
	9:26 AM	Jason:	sweet, thanks, i’ll update
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/alcott-hill-grandview-parsons-chair-alct2090.html
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	in the teal I think
	9:27 AM	Jason:	elegant. i love it.
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	some color for my windowless little office
	9:30 AM	Jason:	doing research here
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	on?
	9:33 AM	Jason:	stuff ... you just wait
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	now I’m worried
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	or excited
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	maybe both
	9:33 AM	Jason:	😝
	9:59 AM	Jason:	i’m very enlightened now
	9:59 AM	Jason:	there’s a subtle glow above my head
	9:59 AM	Jason:	(didn’t intend double entendre)
	10:01 AM	Jessica:	you’re killing me
	10:01 AM	Jessica:	I’m scared to even ask....
	10:01 AM	Jason:	time to get back to computer-y work. trying to find a way to get SEO data for Cy. Most tools require that you’re the domain owner.
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	Careful, you’re going to have yourself turned on all day doing research
	10:02 AM	Jason:	that has been a minor problem
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	don’t worry about that. The main things that he needs to work on are what we discussed last night to start with
	10:03 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:03 AM	Jessica:	😂
	10:11 AM	Jason:	read more articles on rotator cuff (not the earlier research). sports med ones were the most helpful. as long as there’s any pain at all, I’m still in the “acute” phase and shouldn’t do any exercises. instead, cold compression.
	10:12 AM	Jason:	when pain is gone, then start very easy exercises
	10:13 AM	Jason:	i’ll order one of the shoulder braces that says it can accommodate an ice pack. supposed to have one on there for like 15 mins every 2 hours
	10:30 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:30 AM	Jason:	made my own cold compression pack. actually feels a lot better.
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	That is HILARIOUS!!!
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	Glad it is helping though...but HILARIOUS
	10:54 AM	Jason:	and sexy
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	ummm, yeah..that’s what I was thinking 😳
	10:54 AM	Jason:	it’s making me mad. i figured i should have the tools to fix it.
	10:54 AM	Jason:	but also ordered the proper stuff.
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	😂😂
	11:54 AM	Jason:	Listened to NPR a bit but it didn’t put me to sleep today so carrying on. Not sure I’ll make cookies but I’ll clean the house.
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Of course when I actually have an appetite and am starving, Cy moved it to 12:30 😥
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Darn it, you need sleep!
	11:56 AM	Jason:	Oh, bummer. Hang in there. Getting the salmon salad?
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Not sure, last time I had a roasted Brussels sprouts one, they have different specials
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Got my office key😀
	11:59 AM	Jason:	You sent a GIF from Tenor GIF Keyboard.
	12:05 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:15 PM	Jason:	Have a great lunch. Hope you survive until you get your food. 😋
	12:16 PM	Jessica:	Sooo hungry
	12:16 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:17 PM	Jason:	That’s a good thing :)
	1:12 PM	Jason:	a bit weird now to be the one at home, excited to see you come through the door so I can tell you about my day
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:21 PM	Jason:	Oh yum
	1:21 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:30 PM	Jason:	Same but in jug
	1:30 PM	Jessica:	😂😂
	1:30 PM	Jessica:	Chilly up the dress
	1:31 PM	Jason:	for two seconds i thought you meant you somehow got chili, the food, up your dress, and thought, wtf are you doing?
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	that is FUNNY
	1:50 PM	Jason:	nice lunch?
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	I ate half my veggies though :)
	1:50 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:50 PM	Jason:	fill me in later, i supose
	1:51 PM	Jessica:	yep, good lunch. I always feel bad when I have to cut it short because I only have an hour
	1:51 PM	Jason:	maybe that will change when you’re fully in the new role
	1:52 PM	Jessica:	yeah, it will so that will be nice.
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	getting some good quality time with the kitten?
	1:53 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:53 PM	Jason:	Simplified design
	1:53 PM	Jason:	She’s been lazy today
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	1:55 PM	Jason:	And maybe hiding since I vacuumed
	1:56 PM	Jason:	Don’t see her now. Was just laying on pillow.
	2:04 PM	Jessica:	that was more about your contraption

	2:15 PM	Jason:	salad power, GO!
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:42 PM	Jason:	Surviving?
	3:44 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	barely
	4:08 PM	Jason:	Want anything when you get home? Wine and bubble bath?
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	both!
	4:13 PM	Jason:	If you’re serious I’ll have it ready
	4:19 PM	Jason:	i can go get a new wine. what would you like?
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	sounds good, you can switch it up if you like.
	4:21 PM	Jason:	just not merlot :)
	4:21 PM	Jason:	walking now
	4:21 PM	Jason:	brenna at girls
	4:22 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

	4:22 PM	Jason:	Maybe
	4:23 PM	Jason:	No plan to molest, want you to be able to relax
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	Hunters meds!
	4:35 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	9:09 AM	Jessica:	My conversation:
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	Oh man! I totally missed this. YES. Let’s do something. Soon. What you up for? Wanna come hang with some fun ladies tomorrow for a bit with live music? I’m going to see a friend off to a pageant, and some other various friends will be there. If not, all good. I miss you!

Right? Super fun.
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	Going to get more sleep?
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	Hoping you are sleeping, I’ll be out and about shopping from 10:30-1. Going to be totally honest, I feel really raw and sad today.
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:21 AM	Jason:	That’s funny. Yeah, I put on your sleep mask. Just woke up. Jeebus.
	11:23 AM	Jessica:	Good!!
	11:23 AM	Jessica:	Funny on the mask
	11:25 AM	Jason:	I feel the same today. But let me try to add a smile for us both. This week has had an effect: just about any time I think of you I get an erection. 😮
	11:26 AM	Jason:	(same as what you said above)
	11:27 AM	Jason:	*feel the same as what you said above
	11:27 AM	Jason:	*crap, stop editing yourself!

	12:04 PM	Jason:	I know it’s in chat somewhere but too far to scroll: to whose attention do I send the rx?
	12:12 PM	Jessica:	Sissy?

to love what death can touch.

A fearful thing
to love, to hope, to dream, to be –

to be,
And oh, to lose.

A thing for fools, this,

And a holy thing,

a holy thing
to love.

For your life has lived in me,
your laugh once lifted me,
your word was gift to me.

To remember this brings painful joy.

‘Tis a human thing, love,
a holy thing, to love
what death has touched.

— Yehuda HaLevi (c. 1100)

	9:07 AM	Jason:	having mercy and keeping office quiet for now
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	yeah, he was up until 4am the night before ;)
	9:14 AM	Jason:	well, not sure i’ll wait until afternoon. i do like working to a bit of music, especially since there are no other sounds (people)
	9:14 AM	Jason:	how has your morning gone?
	9:14 AM	Jessica:	and he needs to get a routine going.
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	it was INSANE. Just sat down, I think I have my steps in for the week in a few hours 😂
	9:16 AM	Jason:	jeez. nice work taking control of your thoughts and choosing a positive perspective 😜
	9:17 AM	Jason:	so maybe i’ll start the thrash metal (music) at 10:00
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	okay smart ass
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	yeah, 10 seems good
	9:22 AM	Jason:	looking at frame ideas before choosing print size. these are nice, but $30 x 31 is maybe too much https://www.amazon.com/ArtToFrames-Floating-Pictures-13-5x16-5-Acrylic-109-11x14-MutedChrome/dp/B06XDMPW6W/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1513614110&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=floating+frames&psc=1
	9:31 AM	Jason:	NO
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	That is HILARIOUS!! I don’t want to hear another word about your toenails
	9:35 AM	Jason:	Maybe we do that one to YOU
	9:36 AM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	yeah, $30 is spendy :(
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	aren’t you funny
	9:36 AM	Jason:	maybe hunter would have fun getting in on it. i could assign him some elf prep.
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	good idea
	9:36 AM	Jason:	on taking out garbage, etc.
	9:36 AM	Jason:	*and
	9:38 AM	Jason:	https://www.walmart.com/ip/11-x-17-Black-Snap-Wood-Frame/46542589
	9:38 AM	Jason:	not floating but simple
	9:39 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, I like those
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	If I did 4 rows of 6 that would give me 24 and then did 3 larger one on the back wall, 27. so need to weed out 4
	9:42 AM	Jason:	similar with thinner frame https://www.amazon.com/Mainstays-12x18-Format-Picture-Frame/dp/B01C05KI86/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1513615214&sr=8-5&keywords=mainstay+frames
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	I want to do more of a motivational something on the wall behind the chairs
	9:42 AM	Jason:	i would be really proud of you it was ironic motiviation
	9:43 AM	Jason:	*argh, i know how to spell
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	not sure, a lot of spelling errors lately....
	9:46 AM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	9:46 AM	Jason:	so 24 medium size, 3 bigger sized, you’re saying?
	9:47 AM	Jason:	keep in mind the orientations, too. some are portrait, some landscape, so that affects how they’ll arrange togher
	9:47 AM	Jason:	unless you want to crop them all square or something
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	very true so maybe more of a mixed style rather than rows, but same amount?
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	I don’t want it to be too busy
	9:49 AM	Jason:	never hurts to have a few in reserve, under your desk or something, that you swap out
	9:49 AM	Jason:	woah, nice work on the “too” ;)
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	good idea
	9:50 AM	Jessica:	I was waiting for a comment ;)
	9:50 AM	Jason:	k, i’m checking costco native print sizes so don’t have to cut anything
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:52 AM	Jason:	can’t remember costco password. chrome remembers it for costco.com but have to re-enter for costcophoto.com
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	no clue
	9:56 AM	Jason:	Brenna8*. I guess it had already been reset to random by the time I got around to trying that one. Reset it back.
	9:57 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:58 AM	Jason:	12x18 is the size i used for market samples on foam core
	10:00 AM	Jason:	so maybe figure out how big you want the 3 and how big you want the rest ...
	10:04 AM	Jason:	14 weeks of unemployment remain, including this week
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	that’s good
	10:07 AM	Jessica:	I will need to pull out the tape measure to get an idea on sizing
	10:09 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:19 AM	Jason:	music is on
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	good job
	10:38 AM	Jason:	maybe time to leverage the spare bedroom to make brenna clean hers, i.e. no sleeping there until yours is clean
	10:39 AM	Jason:	messier again
	10:58 AM	Jessica:	I like that
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	I know the girls helped demolish it yesterday
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	not that it was clean to begin with
	10:59 AM	Jason:	true, but like we tell her, it’s her job to manage what people do in her room
	10:59 AM	Jason:	she needs to reclaim her agenda -- that’s the chapter I’m just finishing :)
	11:04 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:05 AM	Jason:	finished chapter, working on jerm site now. researched a product idea earlier but there are already a bunch of apps for it
	11:05 AM	Jason:	no from NoRedInk
	11:08 AM	Jason:	that was dev manager for writing app
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	you hadn’t interviewed with them though correct?
	11:08 AM	Jason:	right
	11:09 AM	Jessica:	but it was one you were more interested in
	11:09 AM	Jason:	yes
	11:09 AM	Jessica:	damn it
	11:19 AM	Jason:	i really want to leave enough in savings to get 3 more full months, meaning $9000
	11:19 AM	Jason:	so moved $400 and we’ll get another $405 on thursday
	11:20 AM	Jason:	still jeep payment to cover
	11:20 AM	Jessica:	Okay
	11:20 AM	Jason:	$9400 remains in savings
	11:21 AM	Jason:	open to other ideas if you have any
	11:22 AM	Jason:	that’s about how long until unemployment ends too
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	No other ideas, make sure to update budget to my pay, not much right now couple hundred. A bit more after I pass life and health
	11:27 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:29 AM	Jason:	with your extra pay, we can get by with $2800/month from savings if we’re okay with $450 distributions. leaves a little buffer.
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:38 AM	Jason:	i’ll finish jerm site too and that will be some $
	11:46 AM	Jason:	apparently hunter sleeps just fine to this music 😴

	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Brenna is going to gym today. Mya also doing makeup so Lee is driving both ways, so going to take advantage of that.
	11:59 AM	Jason:	cool. did you leave message at school so she knows? she said she packed for gym but didn’t know if she was going.

	4:21 PM	Jessica:	sorry, been slammed. Did you end up taking her? Reeses in the jeep
	4:58 PM	Jason:	No worries. Lee just called and said Brenna didn’t know if she was supposed to go. Brenna also said she didn’t have leo so Lee was going to stop by. That didn’t happen so I guess Brenna “found” it (she told me she had it this morning).

Tuesday, December 19, 2017

	8:33 AM	Jason:	She couldn’t find elf. Had to pretend I wanted creamer.
	8:35 AM	Jason:	No from Etsy. Frustrating to fail easy interview.
	8:49 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:49 AM	Jason:	Brenna posed
	9:04 AM	Jessica:	I was wondering how she was going to find it. Dang it on Etsy. Funny elf pose

	9:19 AM	Jason:	HOLY CRAP. Hunter just got up.

	9:21 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:23 AM	Jason:	He “might” go to lunch there if he remembers the time. For now, he’s busy with the cat who is happy to have another of her lovers awake.
	9:23 AM	Jessica:	This is my next fall goal. I wanted to do it this fall but figured using up all my weekends for a couple months with an exchange student here wasn’t a good idea. http://files.constantcontact.com/20dca296201/0d164d50-e9cc-4a59-97b5-f4fe16c4dd59.pdf
	9:25 AM	Jason:	That’s awesome! Count on it.
	9:30 AM	Jason:	You want to rotate in with one of the local studios as a teacher? Or just elevate the practice for yourself? You can tell me later. :)
	9:32 AM	Jessica:	I think both
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	This is Brenna’s gym sister, she wanted her last name. So maybe bring the wrapped gift she has when you pick up today, I think she is giving it to her as a Christmas present: Hattie Wokersien
	9:34 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:40 AM	Jason:	Time to fill out another Simplot application ... 😕
	9:43 AM	Jason:	Jesus. Redox just cancelled tomorrow’s interview.

	9:57 AM	Jessica:	I’m not sure there is an appropriate minion for this level of frustration on the job search
	9:59 AM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	9:59 AM	Jason:	everything about these months has done its utmost to destroy my confidence. i guess an opportunity for humility and self-awareness.
	10:00 AM	Jason:	detox of the mind
	10:01 AM	Jessica:	that is very true, also..pretty good minion ;)
	10:01 AM	Jason:	☺

	10:06 AM	Jason:	Later today
	10:06 AM	Jason:	Hunter cleaning litter box
	10:08 AM	Jessica:	he’s all kinds of crazy this morning
	10:09 AM	Jason:	:) he’s definitely been more mature about doing things. asking him to take out garbage yesterday, litter box today, he just says “sure”
	10:09 AM	Jessica:	I wish I was working from home to see that!!
	10:09 AM	Jessica:	though I have noticed the same the couple things I’ve asked him to do
	10:11 AM	Jason:	i told him just now we’ve noticed and appreciate it

	10:32 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.

	10:52 AM	Jason:	Spaz just learned not to stand under me while making bacon
	12:03 PM	Jessica:	Oh no
	12:03 PM	Jason:	Tiny grease splash, not hurt. Did stop her yowling at me.
	12:04 PM	Jason:	Have a nice lunch!
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	Poor baby
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, rushing, got out late
	12:10 PM	Jason:	How nice. Redox *did* add me to their spam list.
	12:42 PM	Jason:	finished simplot application
	12:58 PM	Jessica:	I got gossip
	1:04 PM	Jason:	Excellent work. I look forward to tuning in.
	1:08 PM	Jason:	I’ll take off to shop in about 10 mins, hoping I’ve missed most lunch traffic. Ping if you think of something I should get.
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	that seems silly with Redox-good job on the Simplot app...I think?

	8:49 AM	Jason:	A few minutes, no thanks to you
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	😇
	9:12 AM	Jason:	Wrestling with Tony job had me awake a few times last night. 25K pay cut, uninteresting work, relatively inflexible ... maybe I can find something where I only have to accept 1 or 2 of those. Still wrestling.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	that’s a tough one. I hate for you to take something with that many cons vs pros..yet I knwo this has been a long process
	9:14 AM	Jason:	yeah, that’s exactly the challenge
	9:14 AM	Jason:	woah, I hear Hunter

	9:30 AM	Jason:	eh
	9:31 AM	Jason:	had followed advice somewhere to remove education from resume if not completed but then saw other advice to do something like this, which seems better https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHO3CWC9mTSYAkh87I5BPbuCEu3ux4BONR3EeS6hahs/edit
	9:31 AM	Jason:	opinion? seems better than implying i’ve done nothing educationally
	9:31 AM	Jason:	made that change yesterday
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	i think that looks good
	9:36 AM	Jason:	simplot phone screen at 4:30 today
	9:38 AM	Jessica:	oh, they are moving right along
	9:41 AM	Jason:	been posted since october
	9:41 AM	Jason:	tony can’t find anyone who isn’t stupid
	9:42 AM	Jason:	tough target, though: someone with strong programming experience willing to take a systems engineering job
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	hmmmm
	9:48 AM	Jason:	but now my mind’s on vacasa ...

	12:50 PM	Jason:	my favorite way to cook
	1:27 PM	Jason:	I stood here so many times, straining to
Express the meaning of this anniversary,
To give you the gift of kindness and hope,

A poem,

But every idea ricocheted off the screen’s
Cold marble, meaning scattered like feral
Cats that even metaphors cannot corral,

Leaving nothing

But to accept the moments as they are,
Beyond the compass of words, bare;
Bare but not without meaning.

In fact, more meaningful,

Some say, to simply experience and accept
What language cannot convey — 
Love, hate, hope, sorrow, all at once,

Contradictions

That can exist only in the heart.
And so that is all I have to give you, it seems:
My heart and its highest intentions — 

An ineffable manifesto.
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	Thank you, I really do appreciate your words, especially knowing how long you probably went back and forth writing and rewriting it ;) It’s one of the things I’ve always envied about you, that you can articulate in such a way, always with so much thought put into it.

	7:10 AM	Jason:	I’m still naked
	8:46 AM	Jason:	Made it :)
	8:50 AM	Jason:	i think they’re talking about video games
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	good job. I realized I had the headphones in my bag :)
	9:40 AM	Jason:	the big ones will be awesome;
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	I also forgot my purse in the Jeep and there must be my orzo jar rolling around in the back
	9:41 AM	Jason:	😝
	9:58 AM	Jason:	meeting with jeff today so i’ll talk to him then about early friday departure
	9:59 AM	Jessica:	I sent you the info on the meet in case that will work
	10:17 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:17 AM	Jason:	BTW, everyday at 10am is our stand-up for about 20 mins so always busy then
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	having benefits meeting at 11, will be geting  the new info/rate for Brenna
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:39 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:57 AM	Jason:	remember to measure the length of your picture wall
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	Have you learned when health benefits are in effect, I have to turn my paperwork in today. Dropping you, looking up what you sent me to compare for Brenna
	11:34 AM	Jason:	just that someone is supposed to be contacting me to help me enroll within week of start
	11:35 AM	Jason:	drop me
	11:35 AM	Jason:	fun benefits meeting? 😳
	11:35 AM	Jessica:	always :)
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	is your benefits info in drive? can’t find in email
	11:36 AM	Jason:	sent you link here before, i’ll send again
	11:39 AM	Jason:	e-mail invited to google folder
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:40 AM	Jessica:	you’r eligible Feb 1st
	11:44 AM	Jason:	soon enough
	11:48 AM	Jason:	how much does dropping me save?
	11:48 AM	Jason:	looks like i get rainy rtide
	11:48 AM	Jason:	*ride
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	okay, so just went over everything with benefits. It’s actually going to be much better to keep you and Brenna on mine. Monthly cost is less for Brenna, about the same for you but the deductibles are MUCH better family wise on mine, also we run the risk of 4 different deductibles separating them out. Though we will probably make changes on dental/vision but that’s chump change
	11:59 AM	Jason:	really? better to keep me on yours? so vacasa doesn’t cover much?
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	call me
	12:00 PM	Jason:	office
	12:00 PM	Jason:	?
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	or come on over :)
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	208-947-5252
	12:00 PM	Jason:	would like to; company meeting thing.
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	oh yeah
	12:18 PM	Jessica:	umm, please don’t kill me
	12:29 PM	Jason:	uh, what?
	12:31 PM	Jessica:	Message from Heather:
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	Things are bad here.  Im leaving. I know it is allot to ask. But can we come stay for a bit.  Hopefully not long.  If needed ill live in my car.
	12:33 PM	Jessica:	I told her if she needed to go to the house that was fine, obviously we would make room in the extra rooms for them until she can sort things out. Hoping nothing comes of it as usually happens but just a heads up.
	12:33 PM	Jason:	Always happy to help family. Mostly. To a point. :-)
	12:33 PM	Jessica:	I figured that would be your response ;)
	12:35 PM	Jason:	Can’t imagine she would really want to stay with us with kids and all
	12:36 PM	Jason:	Ate too much. Small salad and half-sandwich. Stuffed.
	12:37 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, I highly doubt it’s a long term thing, just being available if needed. It makes so much more sense for Eric to stay with Matt if needed.
	1:55 PM	Jason:	ooh, company meeting 😏
	2:00 PM	Jason:	in case you missed it earlier: measure your wall :)
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	$#@!
	2:01 PM	Jason:	What?
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	Current Heather message, as predicted:
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	I’m seeing what happens we set some guidelines with Colby.  If those turn into a shit show.  I may need to take him away for a bit too keep him and Eric apart so Colby can focus on finals
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	I’m so ready for april 26
	2:04 PM	Jason:	Colby’s 18th?
	2:47 PM	Jessica:	yep
	2:48 PM	Jason:	getting studying done?
	3:02 PM	Jessica:	trying
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	Going to hit Costco and then maybe a couple shoe places
	4:08 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:08 PM	Jason:	Back to the mall?
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	Probably like Target or Nordstrom rack, avoiding the mall..unless Dillard’s or Macy’s where I can get in and out fast
	4:11 PM	Jason:	Good luck! 😘
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	In heels, don’t want to walk alot
	4:11 PM	Jason:	Maybe out of here in 30
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	Wish I remembered what else at Costco
	4:13 PM	Jason:	hmm, only know drugs
	6:19 PM	Jason:	K-cups!

	9:01 AM	Jessica:	Asked Heather for surgery update:
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	that recovery is a bitch-2-3 months in a sling NO movement-then 5-6 months of physcial therapy-uhhhhhh yeah. I am trying to see if some light physcial therapy due to having a lot of muscle and strength in that arm can help heal over time-or surgery is inevitable. he said more than likely I am going to be coming back in a month or less to schedule but trying this before making that dreadful commitment.
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	Eric goes in for surgery on his face again-as aggressive skin cancer right above his eye they want out asap-so he is scheduled for Monday. Need to get that done and out of the way.

	9:07 AM	Jason:	login with Vacasa/benefits
	9:09 AM	Jessica:	do you want to start a conversation on my appetite?You are standing in a room full of people. But if you would like to come over and rub me and lock the door...
	9:10 AM	Jason:	you make a good point
	9:39 AM	Jason:	we like to look at cool rentals sometimes. here’s one for us:
	9:39 AM	Jason:	https://www.vacasa.com/unit.php?UnitID=2004
	9:41 AM	Jason:	i get my discount the we could split the cost with some folks we like :)
	9:41 AM	Jason:	*then
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	that is amazing
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	damn it, another nail broke
	10:14 AM	Jason:	crapo. better get to the salon.
	10:24 AM	Jason:	made an irish cream americano
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	yummy
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	so my understanding is on the insurance, thoe rates are per paycheck, so time 26 for you correct?
	10:30 AM	Jason:	correct
	10:30 AM	Jason:	looks like my dental/vision cost is $0 so might as well do that
	10:30 AM	Jessica:	exactly
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	yeah so annually for the three of us our current cost is $8136
	10:34 AM	Jason:	big number
	10:34 AM	Jason:	for medical or for everything?
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	if we did us under yours the numbers are: $12,112.62 - $9921.4 - $14,334.58
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	depending on which plan
	10:36 AM	Jason:	okay, so yours is cheaper. how much do we save by dropping my dental/vision from yours? i just want to save money somewhere :)
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	my dental/vision also covered, currently pay 90.57dental & 17.90 vision monthly for you and Brenna
	10:38 AM	Jason:	oh, does dropping me from those do nothing?
	10:39 AM	Jessica:	yep, will save about 100 a month I think. I’ll grab the breakout on those real quick from Doug
	10:39 AM	Jason:	okay, sounds like i should finish my sign-up, decline medical, accept dental/vision and of course 401k
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	yep
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	Jody just mentioned you may need to check if they require your enrollment in medical to get the free dental/vision, some companies do
	10:43 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	10:48 AM	Jason:	hmm, can’t remember my disability coverage through nw mutual
	10:49 AM	Jason:	~$35/paycheck if i enroll here
	10:49 AM	Jason:	seems like the coverage there was just to make-up the diff so should enroll here
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	that is a different type of coverage, keep the NWM one for sure. I’ll ask Max really quick
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	how much coverage?

	10:59 AM	Jason:	oh, for disability? decline it altogether?
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	hold on
	11:18 AM	Jessica:	He’s still busy. I would decline, you have a really good policy.

	1:35 PM	Jason:	i noticed you had the sexy ones on
	1:40 PM	Jessica:	I try for prettier ones when I’m wearing boring clothes..just for a touch of something girly ;)
	1:44 PM	Jason:	👸🏻

	5:26 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a GIF.
	5:27 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	5:27 PM	Jessica:	I pictured in my head
	5:27 PM	Jason:	your picture was most likely correct
	5:27 PM	Jason:	a few swipes with the rake, a tumble of leaves down the yard and into the pond
	5:27 PM	Jason:	wtf

Monday, March 19, 2018

	8:42 AM	Jason:	Cool, it’s a USB powered fan :)
	8:49 AM	Jessica:	What?
	8:50 AM	Jason:	It doesn’t have a wall plug. It has a USB plug.
	8:50 AM	Jason:	Was concerned at first but it works just as well. :)
	9:05 AM	Jason:	Vacasa gave me a $40 Amazon card
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	I didn’t even think to check if it plugged in or not. Glad it worked out. Is it powerful enough?
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	That’s nice of them
	9:06 AM	Jason:	Yep. Already done with it. :)
	9:06 AM	Jason:	And there were coffee beans
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	WHOA...you are having a good Monday!
	9:07 AM	Jason:	So far so good. Hope yours goes well. Saw the Biology reply.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	shocking, he didn’t turn it in
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	I’ll print the other sheet
	9:14 AM	Jason:	You keep him focused on History today. I can circle back with Biology and Gov tomorrow.
	9:14 AM	Jason:	If that sounds good :)
	9:50 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:55 AM	Jessica:	Nice
	9:57 AM	Jason:	school trip yet?
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	Just back, spoke with Ellinghouse and officer Thomas
	10:10 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:10 AM	Jason:	you got deluxe treatment
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Ellinghouse is counting Thursday as one of his suspension days so you don’t need to stay home tomorrow
	10:11 AM	Jason:	nice
	10:12 AM	Jason:	still gonna be a homework night after school
	10:12 AM	Jason:	tomorrow
	10:12 AM	Jessica:	He checks in at the office with his laptop tomorrow to be brought to detention and turn in his phone to the teacher. Lunch and breaks separate from when the others take theirs
	10:12 AM	Jessica:	Agreed.
	10:15 AM	Jason:	Any other details emerge about the offense?
	10:15 AM	Jessica:	nope
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	he’s sticking with his version
	10:17 AM	Jason:	is that different from the other hunter’s version? just curious, really. doesn’t really matter at this point.
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	I think slightly, seems to be more around whether it had nicotine in it or not
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	Our Hunter says yes, the other says no. Hunter is saying that’s why he wasn’t smoking it because he doesn’t use the ones with nicotine in them, makes him sick. Which I will say so far I have found to be true. All of his stuff I find has no nicotine. I think he follows along and thinks he looks cool because everybody else is doing it. Like the beer thing, doesn’t actually drink it or like it
	10:21 AM	Jason:	Agree with your assesment ... if only we could make academic achievement seem cool.
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	so true
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	They reviewed with him it doesn’t matter even if he wan’t smoking it. IF he’s standing by somebody that is...he’s still in trouble. Kind of like accessory to the fact. Officer Thomas reviewed that until he’s 18, if caught with it..he will write him an $80 ticket
	10:26 AM	Jason:	alright, next mission: passing grades
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	We’re going to go sit at Locovore and have some breakfast-work on stuff.
	10:28 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:28 AM	Jason:	Sounds nice
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	maybe, we’ll see if it helps the battle
	10:29 AM	Jason:	set the expectation that i’ll be doing homework with him this and tomorrow evenings too, if he seems amenable
	10:30 AM	Jason:	he doesn’t try to argue with me as much so you can leave that to me if easier
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	okay, we’ll see how it goes
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	well, we’re up and running and he’s seems to be on board so far
	10:59 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:59 AM	Jason:	Your word, btw
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	oh hell
	11:05 AM	Jason:	third americano. i have super powers now.
	11:06 AM	Jessica:	yikes!
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	your turn
	11:20 AM	Jessica:	ugh, my vpn not happy
	11:20 AM	Jason:	oh darn
	11:20 AM	Jason:	connection too slow there?

	9:12 AM	Jason:	Yeah, bummer for them
	9:13 AM	Jason:	Good luck studying!
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	If it wasn’t such damn boring material
	9:18 AM	Jason:	We’re locked out of our room
	9:26 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny..how did that happen?
	9:27 AM	Jason:	We think cleaners
	9:28 AM	Jason:	just got in
	9:29 AM	Jason:	now i need coffee!
	9:29 AM	Jessica:	hope it’s fixed..otherwise..BACON :)
	9:31 AM	Jason:	espresso machine was all put back together and no note on it so i tried to use it
	9:31 AM	Jason:	terrible noise ensued
	9:31 AM	Jason:	latte does sound really good, actually
	9:32 AM	Jason:	maybe go down there
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	you biked in the rain, you deserve it
	9:35 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	good job, a bit jealous
	9:37 AM	Jason:	I deliver
	9:38 AM	Jessica:	it’s raining, I can make my coffee work
	9:40 AM	Jason:	okay, if you’re sure
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	I’m good, thanks though. Maybe lunch if it’s not to icky out there?
	9:41 AM	Jason:	Sounds good
	11:46 AM	Jessica:	Is it raining?

	11:50 AM	Jessica:	that works for me, farro kale sounds good
	11:51 AM	Jason:	i’ll meet you there?
	11:51 AM	Jessica:	yep, heading out
	11:51 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:56 AM	Jason:	Seated way back by kitchen

	2:15 PM	Jason:	perfect
	2:15 PM	Jason:	nobody has said anything yet
	2:15 PM	Jason:	that would help
	2:49 PM	Jason:	woah, what was the money for?
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	Mattresses. Remember I was going to use my bonus money for that/bedding, I thought said to use from that rather than pull from billing?
	3:00 PM	Jason:	hope it helps you sleep well ;)
	3:01 PM	Jason:	(didn’t remember but sounds good)
	3:05 PM	Jessica:	I found a good deal online then printed it  ran over and gave them a chance to beat it at the store, saved over 300😁
	3:05 PM	Jason:	you’re always good at that stuff
	3:09 PM	Jessica:	yeah, I would say two plush queen sets for $700 was a deal. If things change down the road..the beds they have currently can be tossed after years of being peed on and teenage nastiness. You can move $ from billing over instead or whatever, I just thought that was how you wanted me to do it, maybe I misunderstood
	3:10 PM	Jason:	sounds good. already moved money. :)
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:11 PM	Jason:	why two sets?
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Brenna’s room and me
	3:12 PM	Jason:	oh yeah
	3:12 PM	Jason:	my brain should know that

	3:27 PM	Jason:	Enjoy the front
	3:28 PM	Jessica:	Ugh, I hate the front now because most of the calls are for me, so really hard to send them to my voicemail 😬
	3:31 PM	Jason:	use your sweet voice up front and your husband voice when in the office. nobody will know.
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	I think your feet are going to get wet again
	4:14 PM	Jason:	i think you’re right
	4:14 PM	Jason:	you must be up front where you can see outside

	8:09 PM	Jason:	oh jeez
	8:09 PM	Jessica:	I haven’t heard a word in 45 minutes 😂
	8:09 PM	Jason:	that’s funny
	8:09 PM	Jason:	and she came out here too and said nothing
	8:10 PM	Jessica:	I feel like parental duties are nailed for the evening
	8:11 PM	Jason:	definitely 😂
	9:38 PM	Jessica:	Slacker
	9:38 PM	Jason:	oh yeah. just getting brenna tucked in.

	9:03 PM	Jason:	Brenna like the place?
	9:06 PM	Jessica:	Yes, we did have a talk because there were so many questions, I didn’t want to be dishonest with her. She actually was really okay with it. I think another room sens exciting and that we obviously are getting along well and doing things as a family still made her feel okay with it all. I told her if she has questions she can speak with either of us
	9:07 PM	Jason:	Okay, good. On that topic, maybe movie, river walk or something simple tomorow ... if you feel like it.
	9:07 PM	Jason:	I have more yard work planned.

	1:59 PM	Jessica:	the rest of those bath bombs from state
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	I feel SOOO grouchy today
	2:00 PM	Jason:	oh cool, so not a recurring bill
	2:00 PM	Jason:	uh-oh
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	having a period..not sure what the heck
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	no, no more bath bombs
	2:00 PM	Jason:	i have no insight on that
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	holy crap, my email exploded while at lunch
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	I quit this day
	2:01 PM	Jason:	stupid monday
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	I think Lee is going to message you. I told her we were flexible, that you are working from home, I can do whatever as well
	2:03 PM	Jason:	yep, just talked on phone. going to take. maybe she’s dropping mya here first so will be easy.
	2:04 PM	Jessica:	okay, is she picking up or should I?
	2:04 PM	Jason:	she said she’ll pick up
	2:05 PM	Jessica:	okay, I’ll pick up Brenna from the house then

	2:25 PM	Jessica:	I’ll survive I’m sure it will be fine
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	Brenna is asking for computer time
	2:59 PM	Jason:	lee already said she was picking up and i guess didn’t see my addition question so assume she’s still picking up
	2:59 PM	Jason:	i already told her no more computer time
	2:59 PM	Jason:	sneaker

	4:37 PM	Jessica:	ARC supposed to be there tomorrow to get stuff so that needs to be ready.

	4:38 PM	Jason:	ah
	4:38 PM	Jessica:	she knows what’s going, trashed or being stored
	4:38 PM	Jason:	well, i don’t really care about weird, so if there is something you need a quick productivity boost on, glad to help

	10:47 AM	Jessica:	I think so
	10:51 AM	Jason:	i’ve been working. did vacasa daily meeting. won’t have to take day “off” quite so much but ready whenever you two are.
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	Okay, jumping in the shower

Wednesday, March 28, 2018

	8:49 AM	Jason:	woke up feeling rather unwell (throat, headache). maybe that’s why wahooz seemed painful.
	8:49 AM	Jason:	how is your tuesday so far?
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	Oh no!
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Is the Jeep leaking oil? I thought I noticed oil spots yesterday and see more today on the driveway. If that’s the case, better get it in ASAP. Engine will blow up without oil.
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Just seeing how bad the email damage is
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	I’ll call Larry miller now, otherwise take it to the place by Wasabi after work?
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	Sounds like you need a warm whiskey drink and extra sleep
	8:59 AM	Jason:	That would be nice. Makes me feel grouchy.
	9:00 AM	Jason:	Must be a fast leak if there’s a plate-sized spot in the driveway from your brief stop this morning. I’d bring it to Commercial Tire since they can better diagnose the leak than a simple oil change place.
	9:00 AM	Jason:	If the leak is as serious as it looks, you’ll need to take the care anyway.
	9:01 AM	Jason:	*car
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	okay, the commercial tire over here by me I take it. I’ll go drop it off and have Sheryl give me a ride
	9:07 AM	Jason:	i don’t know of a commercial tire by you. i meant the one here so you could grab the car if needed. and so i can walk there if i need to deal with anything. but up to you.
	9:07 AM	Jason:	if you don’t need the car then the one by you makes sense
	9:08 AM	Jason:	i guess you mean there’s one downtown?
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	Commercial Tire
1190 W State St
(208) 258-7539
Open ⋅ Closes 6PM
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	right by me on State
	9:09 AM	Jason:	yeah, that’s right by you. you should do that. :)
	9:09 AM	Jessica:	I don’t need the car until after work, just thinking less driving if it’s leaking
	9:09 AM	Jason:	yeah. leak fix could take days if they don’t have the part, depending on where leak is. but in the past those guys have been fast.
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	okay, I’ll go see who I can give me a ride
	9:10 AM	Jason:	that’s so close, you should walk ;)
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	not in these heals!

	2:14 PM	Jessica:	Don’t kill the fish😂
	2:19 PM	Jason:	that would be bad. gave up on the idea for now. not sure it would matter anyway. trying to solve the weird issue that algea actually grows within the pump housing and makes it clog itself, regardless of how well the water is being filtered before that.

	2:22 PM	Jessica:	Also, was supposed to be here helping out
	2:23 PM	Jason:	Right. They just left.

Wednesday, April 11, 2018

	7:44 AM	Jason:	I hear more than one voice upstairs
	7:49 AM	Jessica:	Getting picked up? Definitely remind him nobody during the week staying over
	7:51 AM	Jason:	Not sure what you mean about picked up. Heard talking but then ignored breakfast invite. I think one more chance then upstairs room is lost. I’ll talk tot him after school since he’s pretending to be asleep now.
	8:02 AM	Jessica:	Okay
	8:35 AM	Jason:	Was trying to think of some limits that he won’t perceive as belittling. I don’t want him to feel that way since I think it’s already a struggle. But it was pretty clear as I left, the sound of boys yelling upstairs, that they’d staid up all night playing. Which would be fine sometimes if his grades were solid. But you know ...
	8:35 AM	Jason:	Maybe we could grab a cafeteria salad and agree on some ideas. I have a few. Still happy to get up early and make him breakfast, sit with him for homework. But even that is messed up when he doesn’t sleep.
	8:39 AM	Jessica:	Sounds good. Can’t
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	About to say maybe not today for lunch. Training so lunch being brought in and counseling. Will know in a bit
	8:40 AM	Jason:	Oh, no worries. Maybe after your workout when I’m rubbing your muscles?
	8:40 AM	Jason:	One idea was to move XBox to living room and remove TV from his room, leaving him with upstairs room.
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	Good idea
	8:50 AM	Jason:	Sorry to hear about more training, btw 😁
	9:19 AM	Jason:	i’m taking from school today, right?
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	I think I may have gotten out of some of the training :)
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	Yep, your pick up
	9:40 AM	Jason:	How did you do that?
	9:44 AM	Jessica:	it’s a new format so most of it is more sales flow focused rather than product focused...which doesn’t currently help me, plus I’m swamped today
	9:45 AM	Jason:	ah ... you used reason
	9:50 AM	Jessica:	:)
	9:51 AM	Jason:	maybe time for quick lunch, then. you can let me know. i’m flexible.
	10:00 AM	Jessica:	will keep you posted. I have counceling at 11 so maybe after that
	10:15 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:25 PM	Jessica:	I’m covering the front for an hour, could do a late lunch though I know you are leaving a bit earlier so not sure that works today
	12:25 PM	Jason:	late lunch is fine. i’m embroiled with a thing making me angry anyway. 😡
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	uh oh
	12:27 PM	Jason:	nothing huge, just getting some automated tests to run and combine on a service where I can’t quite see what folders it’s looking at and it takes several minutes each time i make a change to see if it worked
	12:29 PM	Jessica:	get it working
	12:30 PM	Jason:	thank you
	12:30 PM	Jason:	you should have been a cheerleader
	12:30 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	I’m available when you are
	1:19 PM	Jason:	i’ll head your way
	2:29 PM	Jason:	thanks for lunch :)
	2:57 PM	Jason:	bike time
	3:06 PM	Jessica:	No problem, zoom zoom
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	6pm float tomorrow
	4:36 PM	Jason:	weeds pulled and whiskey poured
	8:35 PM	Jessica:	May have a chance
	8:36 PM	Jason:	woah, look at you go
	8:37 PM	Jason:	not sure what the word is
	8:37 PM	Jason:	whats/watts?
	8:37 PM	Jessica:	Yep it’s stupid..I shouldn’t have been allowed to play it but....
	8:37 PM	Jason:	better that than giving up 😀
	8:38 PM	Jason:	brenna wants to video chat while i make her dinner
	8:38 PM	Jessica:	WATS

	8:38 PM	Jason:	not sure that helped
	8:38 PM	Jessica:	Just for a minute, Dana and I about to leave shortly
	8:44 PM	Jason:	The video chat ended.
	10:06 PM	Jason:	Reading to Brenna a bit then sleep. Sweet dreams.
	10:10 PM	Jessica:	Sweet dreams. I threw a fit and had clams since I can’t have seafood 😂😥

	9:22 PM	Jason:	And besides, homework *always* has to be done
	9:22 PM	Jason:	He still wanted to argue

Monday, April 23, 2018

	8:23 AM	Jessica:	Shocking.. Hunter tried to not go to school because of a headache
	8:34 AM	Jason:	Phbbt. I NEVER saw him again after you left. I assumed he went to bed and slept a ton.
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	Sure he was on his laptop
	9:28 AM	Jason:	Mind if we/you give Bijan a ride to airport as well?
	9:28 AM	Jason:	(hint: I already told him we could)
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	sounds good :)
	9:43 AM	Jason:	how is your monday? pretty quiet here.
	9:44 AM	Jason:	oh, i have hike pictures in a shareable spot if you’d like to see them pre-blogged
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	Yes 😁
	9:59 AM	Jason:	https://adobe.ly/2HVerkG
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	very nice
	10:18 AM	Jason:	:)
	10:19 AM	Jason:	i have low motivation today
	10:24 AM	Jason:	can i stay home?
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	depends, do you have a headache?
	10:28 AM	Jason:	hmm. i could if that’s the condition.
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	this car poling thing is getting irritating. Nobody can ever take
	10:41 AM	Jason:	:(
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	Lee never can Tuesday or Wednesday now and she keeps booking a 4:00 Friday salon client. Even though the previous week she says I will help more next week if I cover the current one. Feeling irritated
	10:44 AM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s not helpful. Maybe it would be better to just have a permanent schedule instead of having ot figure it out every week.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	(still searching for mojo)
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	The problem is the permanent schedule seems to be nobody available Tues/Wed and half the time not Friday. I told them I can’t do take three days a week taking/leaving work early and it’s only been feasible so far when you and I split it up but that’s not an option this week. They both have husbands and other people to help out as well. It’s silly that it’s on us every week. I told them I can only take once this week.
	10:54 AM	Jason:	takine once seems fair, especially since we usually do it twice (me/you)
	10:57 AM	Jessica:	exactly and numerous times one of us picks up Friday when Lee bails. Since she knows she can’t take Tue/Wed it would be helpful for her to NOT book a client Friday at that exact time. Venting, I’m getting irritated about it lately. I’m just not doing them all this week.
	10:57 AM	Jason:	if it helps, i can uber to the airport today
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	no, because I need to get Brenna anyway. The point is THEY can be more helpful and rotate between their family sometimes. They keep depending on us to cover too much.
	11:00 AM	Jason:	agreed
	11:01 AM	Jessica:	Especially when they keep agreeing, bailing and we cover and they say next week they’ll make up for it..like last week and now not available. They knew for a week to make arrangements. Okay, done venting.
	11:05 AM	Jason:	[ trying to formulate reply that doesn’t trigger more venting ] 😂
	11:05 AM	Jason:	i know it’s frustrating, especially with everything on your plate
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	I just need to push back more
	11:23 AM	Jason:	we need to have a Westworld watching “date” night :)
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	Reviews say it’s really good
	11:57 AM	Jason:	saw the same
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	I don’t know what’s in the water..but NOT a quiet day here
	11:58 AM	Jason:	uh oh. shut your door and hang sign.
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	phone off the hook, I needed a mimosa 2 hours ago
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	8, 8 calls in less than two hours, another client showed up..loads of fun today
	11:59 AM	Jason:	you DO need a mimosa
	11:59 AM	Jason:	(and to play a word)
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	oh $#@!
	12:16 PM	Jessica:	that’s all my brains got at the moment
	12:18 PM	Jason:	:)
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	holy crap it’s past noon?
	12:24 PM	Jason:	yeah ... you should have eaten by now
	12:24 PM	Jason:	i’ll probably leave here 2ish, clean pond filter pack, sit around
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	do cashews count as lunch?
	12:49 PM	Jason:	mmm, if you had like two bags then yues
	12:50 PM	Jessica:	I better find a cliff bar or something then 😬
	12:50 PM	Jason:	plenty here
	2:51 PM	Jason:	Rinsed tie dye
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	I think I would have tossed it
	2:55 PM	Jason:	I didn’t know whether it was important
	2:56 PM	Jason:	Lot of work to get all dye out
	5:42 PM	Jason:	On board
	5:46 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

	9:44 PM	Jessica:	He didn’t go anywhere right?
	9:45 PM	Jason:	He did. Was he not supposed to? Seemed like today was chill day. Homework seemed like a lost cause until another night of rest.
	9:46 PM	Jessica:	Still not supposed to go anywhere or have friends over. I told him that.
	9:47 PM	Jason:	Oh. I didn’t know that. I know that’s generally true while homework is outstanding but figured he could have some down time for the rest of day while recovering.
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	With grades, house drama and surgery...I was specific.
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	If he can party with friends, he can get crap done
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	Yep, phone off
	9:50 PM	Jessica:	Going to be honest, I feel like all the parenting things I have been villanized for with him...not any different when in others court.
	9:51 PM	Jason:	I’m not sure I understand ... ?
	9:53 PM	Jason:	maybe phone is easier?
	9:53 PM	Jessica:	Sure

Wednesday, May 9, 2018

	7:41 AM	Jessica:	Leave front door unlocked, Brenna wants to grab her sandals on the way to school
	7:42 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:50 AM	Jessica:	I want more sleep
	7:50 AM	Jason:	Me too. Brain was talking. Bed too crowded?
	7:51 AM	Jessica:	They all got kicked out eventually. New dishwasher arrived at 6:30am🤔😵😡
	7:52 AM	Jason:	Ugh. Who works at that time?
	7:55 AM	Jessica:	Right??
	8:31 AM	Jason:	I need a lot of ffan
	8:35 AM	Jessica:	😂
	8:42 AM	Jason:	big goose crossing today. had to stop.
	8:52 AM	Jason:	listen to these calls placed by an AI https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	I’ll check it out. Just in, allergies going crazy
	9:15 AM	Jason:	:(
	9:15 AM	Jason:	wonder if it’s good or bad that you get open air while driving
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	that’s crazy on the AI calls
	9:28 AM	Jason:	yeah, goodbye call center jobs
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	exactly
	9:43 AM	Jessica:	Doug and Jody just came in to go over the benefits and give recommendations
	9:54 AM	Jason:	Yea. You’re awesome.
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	Doug says to do the Plan 2 and move Brenna to yours. So 145 for both of you. We pay 240 for her on mine and I think 370 for you
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	also cover everybody on the vision as it’s 0 and good to be doubled up on that one
	9:57 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:57 AM	Jason:	about to do meeting here then i’ll read that again and do the sign-up
	9:57 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:15 AM	Jason:	so adding you and brenna as dependents but only covering brenna for medical, right?
	10:15 AM	Jason:	or hunter too?
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	Currently I’ve just had Hunter on Scott’s since it’s been just for prescriptions he’s needed. If we can add him under that same employee/children cost then it’s worth  it to have the double coverage.
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	since it’s not costing us anything more
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	Keeping them on my dental though because mine is better and they have both used the hell out of it
	10:23 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:25 AM	Jason:	on the tip of my tongue --- what is Hunter’s other medical insurance?
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	Kaiser
	10:29 AM	Jessica:	I have the plan info if you need it
	10:29 AM	Jason:	You sent an attachment.
	10:29 AM	Jason:	I think just needed the name. That’s the final elections.
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	very nice, I think that will save us about $450 a month
	10:31 AM	Jason:	sweet
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	my brain really doesn’t feel good
	11:59 AM	Jason:	sleepy? study hangover?
	12:01 PM	Jessica:	have a headache/sinus pressure, thinking maybe the allergies, glad it’s a short day since I’m getting Brenna and have lunch with Tonya shortly. Get some allergy meds in my system before an evening of studying
	12:03 PM	Jason:	Meh. I hope the meds help. I just had a lot of hot sauce. Sinuses clear.
	12:03 PM	Jessica:	that’s one way to do it. Maybe I’ll suggest spicy food for lunch 😂
	12:04 PM	Jason:	maybe some wasabe
	12:04 PM	Jessica:	exactly

	10:32 AM	Jason:	raised it $1500 to $5k
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	that’s ridiculous
	10:34 AM	Jason:	dark clouds

	12:05 PM	Jason:	No. Your name wasn’t in what I wrote. But his was. That’s why I wanted to erase it. I’ve confirmed it’s gone.
	12:15 PM	Jason:	Did you leave avacados? Or are the ones in the fridge left over from my last trip? Putting together shopping list.

	12:37 PM	Jason:	the next savings deposit will cover everything needed for june so take as much as you can from savings now, the rest from credit line, i think

	1:55 PM	Jessica:	I even checked a couple hours ago and no rain in forecast
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	OMG it is raining so hard...
	2:01 PM	Jason:	yes it is
	2:01 PM	Jason:	maybe you can get one of the guys to drive it under cover
	2:02 PM	Jessica:	I feel like it’s not going to matter at this point

	2:04 PM	Jason:	crossing my fingers for you
	2:06 PM	Jessica:	Well if need be I will leave a bit early and hit the vaccums at mister car wash and try and suck some out

	2:33 PM	Jason:	not really
	2:34 PM	Jason:	sometimes

	3:11 PM	Jason:	don’t melt
	3:11 PM	Jason:	i can do it if you’re not dressed for it.
	3:11 PM	Jason:	should have thought of that earlier
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	well then your soaked walking back and forth. I have a jacket and flip flops and I’m pretty fast at doing it.
	3:12 PM	Jason:	alright speedy, go to it

	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Took a word break before I power through some quizzes before bath and bed! This seriously drains me
	9:02 PM	Jessica:	At least the guy on the last two lectures has a jersey accent a bit..more amusing
	9:05 PM	Jason:	Forcing yourself to focus on things that aren’t naturally interesting is really hard
	9:05 PM	Jason:	Checking your word ...
	9:05 PM	Jessica:	Especially after a long day of work

	9:08 PM	Jason:	Sorry 😙

	9:08 PM	Jessica:	okay, my brain is going to have to think on that a bit...my power is low
	9:08 PM	Jason:	Soak and rest
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	so many dates and regs to memorize
	9:09 PM	Jason:	Sounds really awful
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	it really is...just to forget it all
	9:10 PM	Jason:	Plow through 😤
	9:10 PM	Jessica:	or cope
	9:11 PM	Jason:	You’re funny
	9:11 PM	Jessica:	I thought so :)
	9:17 PM	Jessica:	okay, seriously wrapping up now

	9:17 PM	Jessica:	or pinch her
	9:17 PM	Jessica:	whichever is most needed
	9:18 PM	Jason:	Will do. She had two toasted cheese with soup. Should make her tired.
	9:18 PM	Jessica:	goodness, hungry girl
	9:18 PM	Jason:	So far kissed are acceptable
	9:43 PM	Jessica:	I love Megan’s bath bombs
	9:43 PM	Jason:	you’ve been carried away to a blissful meadow?
	9:43 PM	Jessica:	Yes!
	9:44 PM	Jason:	😅
	10:01 PM	Jessica:	Okay, relaxed.. ready for sleep
	10:02 PM	Jason:	Me too. Was able to do push ups for first time in about six months. Now time for rest. Sleep well, Jess.
	10:02 PM	Jessica:	Whoa! That’s a big win!
	10:03 PM	Jessica:	I mean I could but still didn’t so just sad on my end 😂
	10:03 PM	Jason:	😃
	10:03 PM	Jason:	maybe brenna will want to send you another song. never know.
	10:04 PM	Jessica:	We messaged earlier
	10:14 PM	Jason:	You sent a voice message.
	10:14 PM	Jason:	Her request
	10:18 PM	Jessica:	Sweet dreams
	10:19 PM	Jason:	You too 😴

Wednesday, May 16, 2018

	7:47 AM	Jessica:	Tell Brenna I hope she has a fun day
	8:01 AM	Jason:	“Okay, good”
	8:57 AM	Jessica:	I exploded smoothie all over the kitchen this morning..I hope it’s not an indicator of how my day is going to go 😬😂
	9:07 AM	Jason:	Oh god, hope not
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, I would go lock myself ways somewhere if the day tries to go south again!
	9:37 AM	Jason:	understandable. looks nice out there so far. like yesterday.
	9:37 AM	Jason:	gave brenna ride to school in her dress so no bike to pick up
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	oh yeah, am I getting them today or you?
	9:41 AM	Jason:	i’m good to go. unless there’s bunches of rain,
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	:)
	11:03 AM	Jason:	wednesday being better to you?
	11:19 AM	Jessica:	so far so good, this poor elderly lady though I have bee dealing with. If she wasn’t in Oregon I would bring paperwork myself
	11:21 AM	Jessica:	and my coworkers are jerks
	11:21 AM	Jason:	bugging you about testing?
	11:22 AM	Jessica:	they phone me and in a creepy horror voice say 7days...6days...and now have gotten others in on it
	11:22 AM	Jason:	so they’ll understand if they see you having mimosas in your office
	11:23 AM	Jessica:	yeah, we’ve decided that’s a given on Tuesday regardless if I pass or not
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	did you get the credit card thing figured out?
	11:30 AM	Jason:	Haven’t called on that one yet
	11:34 AM	Jason:	I need to figure out WHO to call. I’ll see if I can use the information on the latest window statement to login to WF to see what I can see.
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	just pulled mine, it’s on there as well as an account, not collections..though written off
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	Creditor Information
WELLS FARGO CARD SERVICE
CREDIT BUREAU DISPUTE RESOLUTI PO BOX 14517
DES MOINES, IA 50306

(800) 642-4720
	11:39 AM	Jason:	sweet, thanks
	11:39 AM	Jason:	i’ll call them
	12:12 PM	Jessica:	you must not be eating your fiber bars lately
	12:12 PM	Jason:	i played a word, i thinik
	12:13 PM	Jason:	routine is usual here :)
	12:13 PM	Jessica:	oh dang it you did, not when I had checked earlier
	12:38 PM	Jason:	hmm, playing with experian credit score simulator ... missing payments knocks off huge points but paying off delinquent debt doesn’t do much at all. The only way to get back to having good credit, in this simulator, is missing no payments for four years. :(
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	it seems like that should be way quicker with such a small amount compared to the large things with years of good history :(
	12:47 PM	Jason:	nope. it specifically says having a delinquency after a *good* history is the biggest hit
	12:48 PM	Jason:	takes off almost 50 points per delinquency
	12:49 PM	Jason:	the only threshold that seems to matter is if the delinquency is above $100, which irt was
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	oh thank god I had a salad bag mix in the fridge still
	1:09 PM	Jason:	you need energy. i had ... wait for it ... beet salad
	1:10 PM	Jessica:	just beet, not big beet?
	1:10 PM	Jason:	oh sorry: BIG BEETS
	1:10 PM	Jessica:	better
	1:10 PM	Jason:	😂
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	oh boy, Jared and I are testing the same day
	1:57 PM	Jason:	sounds like you should be quizzing each o ther
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	We are doing a joint review with Kevin Friday
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	Hunter asking for new wifi password, I’ll let you have that talk
	2:57 PM	Jason:	took him a while
	2:57 PM	Jason:	yeah, i’ll be home in 30 mins
	2:57 PM	Jason:	dark clouds but also sun
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	looks like rain later this evening in the forecast
	3:00 PM	Jason:	of course. glad i got some mowing in. maybe dirt moving tonight (remains of garden boxes)

	3:14 PM	Jessica:	that’s a lot of bikes!
	3:46 PM	Jason:	Ooh, rain
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	oh no.....
	3:47 PM	Jason:	It’s warm out though
	3:47 PM	Jason:	Only sprinkle so far
	3:48 PM	Jessica:	Should probably just put the doors back on for a bit, there are scattered thunderstorms over the next week that I can see...and I hate the aveo
	3:52 PM	Jason:	Is piper coming today?
	3:52 PM	Jason:	Girls think yes but not here
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	yes
	3:54 PM	Jason:	Okay, will keep waiting
	3:55 PM	Jason:	Sounds like her mom picked them up in a different place yesterday
	3:55 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez
	3:55 PM	Jason:	Confusing
	3:56 PM	Jason:	Savanah went to search
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	yeah, they need to keep at the same place
	3:56 PM	Jason:	Can’t find her
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	I’ll call Piper’s mom
	3:57 PM	Jason:	Thanks, I don’t have her number
	3:59 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:59 PM	Jason:	Waiting
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	phone went straight to VM, I just messaged
	4:00 PM	Jason:	K, will hold here for now
	4:02 PM	Jessica:	she’s calling piper now
	4:02 PM	Jason:	At least rain stopped
	4:02 PM	Jessica:	that’s good, before wind from freeway 😂
	4:03 PM	Jason:	Girls excited for the drive
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	I bet, forgot it’s their first time this year with doors off

Thursday, May 17, 2018

	8:29 AM	Jason:	Hmm, think I’ll have to start locking my bike in garage. It seems to be making night trips without me.
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	Oh no.....
	8:37 AM	Jason:	Been in really high gear two days in row now, light was all bongled up (new word) and dead. The light doesn’t die before spending a day flashing red, which it hasn’t done.
	8:51 AM	Jason:	get the extra rest you wanted?
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	Damn him
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	Yes, lots of sleep
	9:05 AM	Jason:	yea :)
	9:08 AM	Jason:	i’ve had vertigo since the middle of the night last night. weird. letting you know since you’re my emergency contact. 😁
	9:23 AM	Jessica:	that is odd, what do you think is causing it?
	9:24 AM	Jessica:	shocking, Lee committed to taking tomorrow and now has something.
	9:26 AM	Jason:	no idea on the vertigo. was challenging to balance last night. still feels weird but fine otherwise. did get a little spider bite or something while digging around in yard debris.
	9:47 AM	Jessica:	hmmmm, glad you biked in without running into something ;)
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	We have Colby’s graduation party Saturday evening
	9:48 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:48 AM	Jason:	reminds me: talked to my mom last night. she’ll be here sat morning.
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	okay, that probably works out best. I really need the study time this weekend so good to have kids there. You don’t have to go Saturday obviously with your mom here, I can take the kids or she can come to, whatever seems best
	9:52 AM	Jason:	i would think we’d go but no real plans have been made yet
	9:52 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:59 AM	Jessica:	saw Brenna this morning as they were biking off, I left my book in the car and had to grab it :(
	9:59 AM	Jason:	hopefully done switching vehicles for a while
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	yes, this weather is rather unpredictable at the moment 😂
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	Getting my steps in, covering Madi stuff, multiple trainings happening
	10:26 AM	Jason:	😎
	1:47 PM	Jason:	doing self-eval. new thing they started. :(
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, mine is due as well
	2:13 PM	Jason:	it looks like lyft is still attached to that capital one card
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	oh crap, I’ll go in there right now and uber
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	left my card at red feather yesterday I realized when I tried to pay for counseling 😂
	2:29 PM	Jason:	oh no
	2:57 PM	Jason:	Yas?
	3:16 PM	Jessica:	😇
	3:17 PM	Jason:	i told on you
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	what???!
	3:17 PM	Jason:	yep
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	hey, it’s a word ;)
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	I have to catch up from the 59 point lame word
	3:22 PM	Jason:	i’ll give you that ;)
	5:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	5:47 PM	Jason:	I’ll take some
	5:47 PM	Jason:	Heading to zepole at 6
	5:52 PM	Jessica:	I’ll let you know if they’re good. Some munchies for studying. Just home, giving myself 30min before jumping in
	5:55 PM	Jason:	Study, study
	5:58 PM	Jessica:	yeah, Im stressing
	6:00 PM	Jason:	Understandable. Good sleep, good snacks, you’ll rock it tonight. Let me know if you need anything.
	6:02 PM	Jessica:	thanks
	6:02 PM	Jessica:	looks like hunter was late or absent today, I see a message
	6:04 PM	Jason:	Haven’t seen him. Messaged him about coming to zepole about 45 min ago but no answer. Looks like he went through my bedside drawers too.
	6:05 PM	Jessica:	So done with this crap
	6:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:21 PM	Jessica:	nice
	6:35 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:15 PM	Jason:	For the record, since I imagine it may become an excuse, Hunter said he needed internet to print some things. He says his hot spot is too slow (weird since mine has always been fast). I said “no” but immediately went upstairs and printed what he said he needed, which is all the worksheets for History units 6, 7, 8, which was quite a stack of paper, though only a fifth of the total assignments in those units, most of which aren’t worksheets but something to write up.
	8:15 PM	Jason:	He didn’t seem happy about that and would barely talk. But I handed him all the sheets.
	8:29 PM	Jessica:	Yeah... he’s arguing with me, I’ll send the conversation which explains it
	8:30 PM	Jessica:	Be home now. You can’t be anywhere other than school or home.
	8:30 PM	Jessica:	I have a bad headache so ive been laying in bed
	8:31 PM	Jessica:	I think it’s more likely you are exhausted from sneaking out at night using Jason bike and being up till God knows when. A few more weeks and you’re moving, obviously not getting your crap together
	8:31 PM	Jessica:	Its kinda hard to do stuff when i have no internet and jason doesnt give me the password
	8:31 PM	Jessica:	You know that’s a BS excuse. Y aren’t using it to do homework... haven’t yet that I can tell. Yet you did download another movie illegally which turned off internet again and we could easily get fined thousands at this point. If you want to sit downstairs where you can be monitored that you are actually doing work you will get the wifi. Start taking some damn responsibility for your poor decisions and lack of action a
	8:32 PM	Jessica:	You are down to the last week, I have absolutely no patience left. I’m tired of the laziness, lying, disrespect...all of it. Get it together or go to your dad’s, I’m done
	8:32 PM	Jessica:	Also any tardies or abcenses will be truancies, no more excused
	8:32 PM	Jessica:	Well then theres no point in working at albertsons then or doing anything if youve already decide to send me away
	8:33 PM	Jessica:	Quit being a victim and whining. I’m telling you I will not back down on what the expectation is, I’ve been clear for a long time. If you want to be here, grow up and fix it instead of constantly making excuses and lying, do the work.
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	I seriously can’t deal with him anymore
	8:58 PM	Jason:	That seems pretty clear. Besides, phone network internet is plenty fast for viewing and assignments and entering missing papers.
	8:58 PM	Jason:	“no internet” isn’t true at all
	8:59 PM	Jason:	(finished up some yard work)
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, nothing he says is true
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	My brain hurts
	9:00 PM	Jason:	I bet! Can you call it a night? Or need to push a little farther?
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Nope, sadly most lectures have been 40-60 minutes... This one, two hours 😥🤨
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Half way
	9:02 PM	Jason:	choo choo
	9:02 PM	Jason:	choo choo choose me
	9:02 PM	Jason:	i mean, hang in there ;)
	9:03 PM	Jessica:	😜
	9:17 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:18 PM	Jason:	Brenna’s evening
	9:20 PM	Jessica:	Holy crap it’s clean!!
	10:32 PM	Jason:	You sent a voice message.
	10:41 PM	Jessica:	To bed for me as well
	10:43 PM	Jason:	Good job on the studying. Sleep well.

	7:17 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, wish we could have gone over other chapters.
	7:35 PM	Jason:	Could you meet again before the test?
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	Nope darn it
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	Is Hunter there?
	7:39 PM	Jason:	Haven’t seen him. Actually, you reminded me to go up and check on the meds. I’ll do that now.
	7:41 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:42 PM	Jason:	Not there. Just half eaten muffins and puddings.
	7:49 PM	Jason:	Oh jeez, haven’t gone for Brenna’s bike yet. Been mowing, etc
	7:51 PM	Jessica:	Oops
	7:53 PM	Jessica:	Jeep still mad
	7:54 PM	Jason:	Maybe if we blow out connectors with air

	10:55 PM	Jason:	I think I hear the Hunter vehicle
	10:57 PM	Jason:	Yep, he’s home
	10:59 PM	Jessica:	Yep, I know. He’s ignored all my calls and texts until I said he had 30 min to be home or I would report him and call his dad to book his flight immediately. He responded in under a minute
	11:00 PM	Jessica:	I’ve emailed Scott about booking his flight
	11:04 PM	Jason:	Maybe should have used that to motivate homework
	11:05 PM	Jason:	Frog volume getting higher
	11:12 PM	Jessica:	So frustrated and drained right now.
	11:12 PM	Jason:	Time for sleep

Saturday, May 19, 2018

	9:27 AM	Jessica:	Going to be hard to study when it’s so nice out!
	9:28 AM	Jason:	Definitely. I’ve enjoyed being outside already.
	9:30 AM	Jessica:	I need to grab Hunter at some point, he has yard work to do he owes me.
	9:30 AM	Jason:	Okay. Anytime, of course. And I could use the parking pass if we’re going to walk downtown.
	9:31 AM	Jessica:	Oh and the stupid Jeep light. I’ll run by shortly before I start studying
	12:35 PM	Jessica:	Remind me to grab the blower to use tomorrow
	2:34 PM	Jessica:	Motorcycle outcome?
	2:35 PM	Jason:	Sold and gone
	2:35 PM	Jason:	Kinda sad
	2:36 PM	Jessica:	Ohhhh, are you okay?😥😋
	2:36 PM	Jason:	Will be when I have another 🙂
	2:37 PM	Jessica:	Yep, no empathy now
	3:32 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	Shopping?
	3:38 PM	Jason:	A bit. Bought that jacket half price with armor.
	3:39 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	4:26 PM	Jason:	Got card and cash
	4:37 PM	Jessica:	Thank you
	4:38 PM	Jessica:	If you want beer grab it, or I have some here. It rum and Mike’s hard lemonade there
	4:38 PM	Jason:	We’re downtown
	4:39 PM	Jason:	Maybe bring a couple beers
	4:39 PM	Jason:	No big deal
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Okay, will meet you there then
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	Oh wait, drink thing... damn.
	4:43 PM	Jason:	Ah, forgot that. We can get it if essential.
	4:44 PM	Jessica:	It is. Probably easier for me to swing by and get the this point
	4:44 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:02 PM	Jessica:	Didn’t realize you were buying today as well
	5:02 PM	Jason:	Wasn’t expecting it to work, actually
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	Cost difference?
	5:05 PM	Jason:	Buying today vs later? Or between two motorcycles?
	5:06 PM	Jessica:	You missed a call from Jessica.

Sunday, May 20, 2018

	10:18 AM	Jason:	Good study morning
	10:18 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:19 AM	Jessica:	Shortly
	3:20 PM	Jessica:	so how much was financed EXACTLY as I see ICCU deposits etc happening
	3:26 PM	Jason:	I held some back for sales tax and a luggage connector so closer to 15K. I made sure it’s what I said, though: not more than $100 monthly impact to budget.
	3:27 PM	Jessica:	you’re an ass
	3:48 PM	Jason:	http://www.wranglerforum.com/showthread.php?t=210007
	4:40 PM	Jason:	Hey Jess, I’m sad and sorry you’re upset. I was careful to insist on an interest rate and amounts to ensure our budget plans and possibilities are unaffected. I saw no cause for concern if the budget impact could remain negligible.

And if things don’t work out :( this is obviously separate debt.
	4:45 PM	Jessica:	You as usual did not listen to a word I said the other day. I think you tell people what they want to hear with the purpose of you being comfortable and or having the outcome you want. AS usual, at a time I ask for support as I have something big on my plate, you blow it up and create way more stress for me. Yes, it will be separate  debt since you decided a 15k purchase I did not need to be consulted on. As usual, when Jason wants something..it happens, no matter the cost financially or otherwise. Enjoy it, I’m done.
	7:44 PM	Jessica:	But would judge the hell out of anybody that did the same
	8:07 PM	Jessica:	I didn’t realize the first part didn’t send. I was on my phone. Though it all seems pointless anyway so never mind.
	9:10 PM	Jessica:	Bringing Brenna to and from tomorrow, no need for bike out
	9:10 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Monday, May 21, 2018

	10:54 AM	Jessica:	Hunter got 1000 on SAT
	10:55 AM	Jason:	(reading up on score meanings ...)
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	you can login and look
	10:56 AM	Jessica:	User name HunterScott2018
	10:56 AM	Jessica:	Pass: Pfmaiwpfy2
	10:56 AM	Jessica:	https://www.collegeboard.org
	10:56 AM	Jason:	checking it out, thanks
	11:01 AM	Jason:	Do you see the scores in there? I click “View Your Scores” and see “Don’t See Your Scores?" with errata
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	try username HunterScot2018
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	oops
	11:04 AM	Jason:	there we go. tricky.
	11:04 AM	Jessica:	I had to redo his account, didn’t realize I messed up the spelling
	11:09 AM	Jason:	I guess no surprises with that score. Matches his other academics.
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	yeah, actually surprised not lower considering no studying and his effort level
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	I’m still trying to email Scott. He and Hunter haven’t talked in weeks and Hunter avoiding him. Hunter can just start staying with me after this week. No reason for you to deal with it any longer.
	11:58 AM	Jason:	I don’t mind giving Hunter some say in it. I think I’ve pretty much figure out everything that needs to be locked now. :)
	12:23 PM	Jessica:	We can discuss it more as school ends and we start figuring out things with us.
	12:24 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	I have to be honest, I’m pretty hurt that you chose to be so disrespectful and prove my thoughts mean nothing on a weekend before my exam. Things were already difficult enough.
	12:39 PM	Jason:	I am sorry it came across that way, Jess. I definitely don’t want to add stress ahead of your exams. You’re worried enough. I thought ensuring negligible budget impact would keep it from concern. I was thinking about that. I was careful about that. I think you’ll do great on your test. I hope you’'ll feel confident and collected.
	12:53 PM	Jessica:	No, you were thinking about you. If you hadn’t wanted it to have a negative impact...you would have discussed it with me..as I had just sat and discussed the previous week with you the importance of that when it is was going to be a 3k expense you had planned on without mentioning to me. So not only did you do the EXACT thing I asked you not to do, you were dishonest in the amount numerous times and not once talked with me about it. Once again as I stated before, it’s not about the money, rather your lack of respect listening to me, lying to me that you would communicate going forward and the hypocrisy you continue to display. How would you have felt if I had gone and made a 20k purchase without telling you and my response was (once you found out) “don’t worry, I figured it out financially”? All that in itself makes me furious. What make me horrifically sad, what has had me in tears since yesterday morning is the realization that we are just to broken, that there are to many things that will just not change with us. I’m exhausted, I’m tired of never feeling like I get the full truth from you or that what you say will actually translate into change. I don’t think you are malicious when you do things like this, I think you just don’t have the ability to understand how your actions affect others emotionally. So no, I am far from confident or collected right now, I feel broken, defeated and just done.
	12:54 PM	Jason:	😢
	12:58 PM	Jason:	meeting ...
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	capital one email change?
	4:56 PM	Jason:	no, just reminding myself if I paid that already this month, hit “save” on page. it should still be the “banking” one.
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	5:02 PM	Jason:	In hopes it might be helpful to consider, I’d offer this feedback on your earlier comment: I don’t think I’d be troubled by a large expense you added to the account if well planned. I don’t actually remember, for example, if Kayla’s student loan is $5,000 or $50,000 (I assume much closer to the former) but I know it’s affordable in the budget and, of course, has a very worthy purpose — so all fair and good that you added it.

I have allowed myself to be irritated by expenses that surprised me (yes, maybe I forgot being told) but that had little to do with the total amount. The need to intervene and “fix” accounts is what I’ve let trouble me. It seems we’ve reacted similarly to a sense of disrespect than actual dollar amounts.
	5:18 PM	Jessica:	I think those are very different situations, AND in the Kayla example I had told you in October, not only that when we got the money from Jeremy SSI over that period (50k) we discussed NOT putting half aside as we knew we would be helping with her college and it was best to use towards current expenses. 8k which I also told you. So to me, not the same. I agree, the main point being disrespect (like agreeing not to pay more on Laura’s because of her laziness and then doing it behind my back), as in I JUST sat down and had this very conversation with you, and as seems to be the case with anything anymore...motorcycle, 2300 purchase for scam stupidity..I never get a straight answer from you etc.. I have to pull a piece out at a time, a number out at a time. Not to mention this IS different, we are separated but still responsible for for everything 50/50...probably a good time to be on the same page when adding a huge amount to our joint debt. What I hear you saying by your actions, is that even if I try and communicate, to sit and resolve something and you agree to my face...it’s out the window if you so desire, not a good way to fix the pile of damage we have. Because you can bet 100%, I’m not wasting my breath trying to resolve or communicate with you again. Justify that however the hell you want.
	5:25 PM	Jessica:	Also, in response to feedback on your last comment? The response tells me that you are justifying why it was okay, not that you take any responsibility for it being wrong. That I haven’t heard yet. That tells me you don’t think this situation was disrespectful even after our previous discussion. That is probably the BIGGEST issue for me.
	5:43 PM	Jason:	I am sorry for being disrespectful, Jess. I’m also sorry for being an agitation here — not my intent, so I think I’ll let my comments end now. :(
	5:53 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, I don’t think you and I will ever be on the same page. The futility of these conversations has become painfully apparent. I’ll touch base on next steps later this week, praying that I get a second chance at this test because even with cramming today I am pretty sure I won’t be passing it which will be more more stress than I can handle tomorrow.
	7:20 PM	Jessica:	Is Hunter there?
	7:20 PM	Jason:	Yep, he was here when I got home
	7:22 PM	Jessica:	tell him to call me please
	7:31 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Tuesday, May 22, 2018

	9:01 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:02 AM	Jason:	Didn’t realize Brenna left note
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	I need to move 100 to my account, where do you want it pulled from. You can deduct Friday
	1:08 PM	Jason:	I think credit line is best option
	1:08 PM	Jason:	done with test?
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	I was done at 9am
	1:09 PM	Jason:	woah. how did it go?
	1:09 PM	Jessica:	exactly as I said it would
	1:09 PM	Jason:	oh jess
	1:09 PM	Jessica:	Hard to pass when you’ve spent days being angry or in tears instead of being able to focus on doing practice tests
	1:25 PM	Jason:	I want to be a comfort but that doesn’t seem to work right now. I’d be glad to have Brenna a bit, or whatever helps, if you want to decompress with friends.
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	No, most definitely not a comfort to me. Don’t worry I have plans with my support group of friends. Brenna is fine, she has gymnastics anyway.
	1:31 PM	Jason:	Do I need to pick up her bicycle or did you drive her?
	1:31 PM	Jason:	(Realized while riding in I forgot to put her bike out)
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	Nope, Dana brought her. I have it covered this week.
	1:32 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:39 PM	Jessica:	Have you planned or thought about the three day weekend? I would like to plan something with kids at least one night day if you would like to split it up. Let me know
	8:39 PM	Jason:	Hadn’t made a plan. I guess I should look at forecast.
	8:41 PM	Jason:	looks about the same as now. maybe sunny. maybe rain. maybe thunder.
	8:41 PM	Jason:	maybe i can overnight with the kids one of the nights but i’m flexible as to which night, i think
	8:42 PM	Jessica:	okay, look forecast wise and let me know and I will plan around that
	8:42 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:44 PM	Jason:	Could I call Brenna?
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	10:03 PM	Jason:	Knew it was Brenna’s bedtime, messenger said you hadn’t been active for a while, thought sms might have more chance of pinging you if messenger was closed or something
	10:08 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:52 PM	Jessica:	Can you do gymnastics pick up. I’m taking, forgot I have Colby graduation
	10:52 PM	Jason:	Sure. I was just invited too but more important you go.
	10:54 PM	Jessica:	If you want to go I can try and get coverage
	10:59 PM	Jason:	I’d like to but not critical. Your call.
	10:59 PM	Jessica:	If I can get it covered I’ll let you know
	11:00 PM	Jason:	Thanks. Otherwise I’ll plan to pickup.

Wednesday, May 23, 2018

	9:53 AM	Jessica:	got it covered
	9:53 AM	Jason:	Cool, thanks. I’ll have Hunter come along.
	9:54 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	Going to have Brenna skip gymnastics today and go to graduation. Piper not feeling well and no longer going, Mya wasn’t today anyway. Her knew still sore and she has the 3 day clinic next week so she can have a recovery day
	1:43 PM	Jason:	Makes sense
	1:43 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:44 PM	Jason:	got free growler today from office cleanup. can i leave it in the jeep sometime to get from you later?
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	yep
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	I leave at 3:30 to get Brenna so you’ll need to put it in before then
	2:34 PM	Jason:	okay, just out of interview thing. i’ll walk it over and set it on the floor in the back. thank you.
	2:41 PM	Jason:	Set in back. Tried to pin it so it wouldn’t roll around.
	2:41 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	6:14 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	6:15 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:21 PM	Jason:	Waiting for hunter ...
	6:32 PM	Jason:	At security
	8:27 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	8:27 PM	Jason:	For you to share
	9:07 PM	Jason:	Pretty sunset
	9:10 PM	Jessica:	Very

Thursday, May 24, 2018

	1:09 PM	Jason:	not sure exactly what my new paycheck total will be with insurance changes so i’ll cancel auto-payments for now and do it manually tomorrow. looks like around $665 distribution with your rent accounted for
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	okay, once I have my new paycheck amount i will plug it in the budget. Sarah said about an extra 300 per pay period
	1:11 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:22 PM	Jason:	were you thinking brenna would stay with you through saturday or something else? no biggie if you aren’t sure yet.
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	not sure yet. Just wanted one day to do something fun with her over the 3 day weekend, flexible
	2:29 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	I got a call regarding an inquiry as to the Jeep’s value you submitted?
	3:00 PM	Jason:	No idea. I did look up the Aveo value on the Kelly Blue Book site yesterday, out of curiosity. Wondering if it’s worth it to get electrical fixed since I don’t have access to Jeep for driving at night, to pick up kids, whatever. Noticed while driving home from graduation.
	3:01 PM	Jason:	I definitely didn’t put a phone number anywhere. So that’s weird. Just filled in the few details.
	3:02 PM	Jessica:	Ok, I’ll disregard
	3:02 PM	Jason:	Yeah, why talk to someone about value anyway? Just click the site. Sounds scammy.
	3:12 PM	Jason:	wasn’t positive about year but fwiw https://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/aveo/2009/aveo5-ls-hatchback-sedan-4d/?vehicleid=226340&intent=trade-in-sell&mileage=65000&pricetype=private-party&options=6459495|true&condition=good&r=840975740513561200
	3:20 PM	Jessica:	2006 I thought
	3:51 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	I forgot Brenna has a half day tomorrow so will have to have her bike since I didn’t ask in advance to work from home.
	4:58 PM	Jason:	I’ll have it ready
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	5:30 PM	Jessica:	Let’s just plan on through Saturday day, I’ll drop her in the evening. Just planning some fun little things for the day. The other days are clearer so you can plan outdoor stuff with her
	5:33 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:34 PM	Jason:	if it’s good for camping and brenna is interested, may ask to use jeep
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	no problem
	6:36 PM	Jessica:	Hunter’s prescription is ready, can you get it?
	7:10 PM	Jason:	sure
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Got it
	7:35 PM	Jessica:	Thanks, he’s been persistent about needing it
	7:36 PM	Jason:	Three bunnies
	7:36 PM	Jason:	Weird about needing it for one week
	7:36 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	yes, brenna told me about babies

Friday, May 25, 2018

	8:33 AM	Jason:	fwiw, only left enough vyvanse in bottle for remaining days of school. put rest in that extra bottle i found in desk drawer.
	8:50 AM	Jason:	distribution was 460 each after subtracting advances
	9:03 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:17 AM	Jessica:	good idea on the vyvanse
	11:20 AM	Jessica:	did you include the withdrawal for Brenna’s all start camp this morning?
	11:21 AM	Jason:	yeah, subtracted half of that from both of our distributions
	11:21 AM	Jason:	plus the 100 you grabbed earlier
	11:21 AM	Jessica:	okay, wasn’t sure if you saw that before distributions, didn’t want it to be a surprise.
	11:22 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:24 AM	Jessica:	also didn’t take anything from billing for grocery for this last pay period
	2:23 PM	Jason:	you leaving early today? we’re moving today but I think needing to take laptops home for the weekend. don’t have a way to carry mine.
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	probably you can put in the Jeep and I’ll drop when I get Brenna, may actually be going by Melissa’s later as well
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	I’ll message when I’m leaving
	2:31 PM	Jason:	okay, i’ll come drop it in the jeep, maybe under the back seat
	2:31 PM	Jason:	so you’re leaving about 3:30?
	2:31 PM	Jessica:	probably
	2:32 PM	Jason:	okay. timing things since it will obviously be hard to work after that. :)
	2:43 PM	Jason:	Delivered plus keyboard etc
	2:43 PM	Jason:	Under Passenger side back seat
	2:45 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:08 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	3:15 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:15 PM	Jason:	Ack!

	3:16 PM	Jessica:	Nice flowers
	3:21 PM	Jason:	Dammit
	8:12 PM	Jason:	shall i offer brenna food (we have a little chinese) or would you like her there straight away?
	8:14 PM	Jessica:	We have food for her
	8:15 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Saturday, May 26, 2018

	1:28 PM	Jessica:	Are you fine with Brenna being there in the morning and switch vehicles or did you need her there this evening?
	1:28 PM	Jason:	that works fine
	1:28 PM	Jason:	make some fun plans today?
	1:29 PM	Jason:	(figured camping couldn’t happen tonight anyway)
	1:31 PM	Jessica:	Market, bacon (she needed another pot pie) looking at evening plans
	1:32 PM	Jason:	nice :)
	3:32 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:32 PM	Jason:	Helping me clean
	4:05 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:05 PM	Jason:	oops, errant click
	8:29 PM	Jessica:	Please send the log in for Laura’s tuition and capital one
	8:29 PM	Jason:	sure. what’s up?
	8:35 PM	Jessica:	Your kidding right? Nothing up, just trying to put real numbers together. I’ve been shut out for many years on certain things, trying to get an actual picture financially as things move forward Like the total after 5 years of Laura’s loans..that would be helpful to plug in.
	8:36 PM	Jason:	okay ... just thought you saw all those totals since they use the banking e-mail
	8:37 PM	Jessica:	nope, I haven’t seen a current outstanding amount
	8:39 PM	Jessica:	I’m not being a jerk, I have Kayla’s too. Just trying to get numbers together
	8:40 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	So, 6400 is the balance?
	8:41 PM	Jason:	yeah
	8:42 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:42 PM	Jason:	Are you making a spreadsheet or something? What are you trying to calculate?
	8:44 PM	Jessica:	So, I’m going to assume you have  a first pass spreadsheet for us divorce wise, maybe share it. Unless you don’t want to...that’s okay to...
	8:45 PM	Jessica:	I’m just starting basic calculations/divisions......reality
	8:46 PM	Jason:	I made a sheet before. i’ll update and share.
	8:46 PM	Jason:	is there a reason you’re focused on this now?
	8:47 PM	Jessica:	seriously???
	8:47 PM	Jessica:	Are you mental?
	8:49 PM	Jessica:	You made your choices, enjoy  the newest motorcycle and additions..25k in you made it clear whats important, enjoy it
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	I just want to have basic numbers, be fair and be done
	8:58 PM	Jason:	That wasn’t my perspective but you seem really intent lately so I just want to focus on fairness and kindness. I’ll fill in a few blanks and send this ...
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	you’re perspective wasn’t that you just spent 25k?After I just tried to resolve our issues about discussing  and being honest about spending money that impacts us both?
	9:02 PM	Jessica:	yeah...fill in those blanks
	9:08 PM	Jason:	My perspective didn’t have an either/or between you and a motorcycle so long as the expense was negligible within monthly budget. I’m not including any motorcycle stuff on the sheet since, together or apart, I expected to bear it myself. I am really sorry it took on such negative connotations.
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	You lied..every fucking day I confronted you and gave you the chance. It was a 3k cconversations that turned into lie after lie..you already knew what you where going to spend and do, spreadsheet etc
	9:11 PM	Jessica:	you LIED ...over and over saying it’s acceptable because you are taking it on expense wise....bullshit and you know it
	9:13 PM	Jessica:	I don
	9:13 PM	Jessica:	Done, don’t care anymore
	9:15 PM	Jessica:	we can just work out the spreadsheets...you should be good with that..it’s logical
	9:18 PM	Jason:	okay, shared sheet. surely mistakes but it has the right formulas, i think
	9:21 PM	Jessica:	oh..you are funny
	9:22 PM	Jason:	i know i probably missed stuff. i went over it just now and deleted things that were wrong.
	9:23 PM	Jason:	and i just now looked up blue book on both vehicles so those should be close. the rest are kinda guesses.
	9:27 PM	Jessica:	yeah, You obviously don’t know some basic idaho laws. I will get you some real numbers this week that the court recognizes. One, get rid of your assessed value crap..means nothhing
	9:28 PM	Jason:	well, we’re just looking at the difference in value between 2007 and 2018 so even if both are, say, 20K low, the difference remains the same. but i figured we might need to pay for a current and historical appraisal if going this route.
	9:29 PM	Jessica:	You have shown me obviously what’s important you. Just threw amicable out the door
	9:30 PM	Jason:	these are just the initial numbers. like i noted right on the sheet, “just first guesses”
	9:30 PM	Jason:	just copied from real paperwork. they’re the only numbers we have.
	9:31 PM	Jason:	maybe zillow or something goes back that far, just as an informational point. i’ll check.
	9:31 PM	Jessica:	nope...doesn’t work the way you are trying to justify..numerous lawyers and realtors have gone through with me..you are off base..
	9:33 PM	Jessica:	50/50 get that in your head.. that’s where we are. and it’s not based on tax assessed value..that is not market sell value..by a long shot
	9:34 PM	Jason:	i guess we’ll have to get some advice. we don’t generally give up equity or assets we held prior to marriage.
	9:36 PM	Jessica:	there wasn’t equity (you brought in debt) and I own the property as well (I’m on the deed, both times)s...thats documented
	9:39 PM	Jessica:	yes, advice, I have a lawyer. I would hate to pay him for stupid crap but looks like that what you want to do..treat me like im an idiot. I just wanted eyes to make sure I wasn’t being stupid or nieve
	9:41 PM	Jason:	not sure why the rudeness. the numbers on the “equity” sheet are copied directly from bank and county statements. nothing excluded or made up. i always knew we might want a better appraised value, which is why i had a column for that to start with.
	9:42 PM	Jason:	we don’t get to decide what is “equity” --- it’s just the difference between mortgage balance and home value
	9:42 PM	Jessica:	rudeness..you are being horrifically rude..it doesn’t work the way you seem to think
	9:43 PM	Jessica:	we get a real value now.. we plug in that number
	9:43 PM	Jessica:	assesed county value is not the number..
	9:43 PM	Jason:	you could be right. i’m not trying to be dogmatic. i just copied in what numbers are on file.
	9:45 PM	Jason:	sure, we can look into an appraiser to calculate a current value and 2007 value
	9:45 PM	Jessica:	You are trying to erase my years of work, marriage everything..yes..that pisses me off. I’m not trying to take advantage but hell yes it will be split equally according to idaho law.
	9:46 PM	Jessica:	also 2007 means nothing
	9:46 PM	Jessica:	we got married, we had joint property.everything 50/50
	9:46 PM	Jason:	assets, equity and liabilities accrued during marriage are split equally, yes
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	property..acquired..while married...50/50
	9:48 PM	Jason:	i’m not sure what you mean. i owned the house in 2001.
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	but thanks for showing me regardless what an ass you are
	9:49 PM	Jason:	again, i’m just putting numbers in a sheet straight from paper statements. how can that be mean? it’s the place to start.
	9:49 PM	Jessica:	and I owned it once financed with WF then with ICCU..why I was on the deed and am currently ON THE DEED
	9:49 PM	Jason:	and i’ve said a couple times now i could be wrong, i’m not dogmatic
	9:53 PM	Jessica:	Why you can’t sell or refinance with-out me signing the quit claim..oh wait you told me I’m stupid and don’t understand that.. soo maybe you know something everybody else doesn’t
	9:54 PM	Jason:	? not sure what you’re referring to
	9:54 PM	Jason:	you already did sign a quitclaim but i don’t know that it’s relevant, hence not mentioned by me
	9:54 PM	Jessica:	it means...I own the property as well 50/50
	9:55 PM	Jessica:	quit claim is when I give up rights...which I’ve only done when refinancing..then I’m on the new deed.
	9:56 PM	Jason:	okay. you may be right. you usually are.
	10:01 PM	Jessica:	so quit with the weird equity thing your trying to do..it’s silly, ridiculous, irrelevant and simply an asshole move. I’m not trying to hurt you...but it seems you are. I want to end amicably, fairly..you don’t seem to care..that breaks my heart. I have to rebuild...from scratch a house/home for myself and Brenna...while you get to keep and walk into yours...be fair, be nice,be loving as I am trying to be. Don’t be selfish and self serving.
	10:05 PM	Jason:	when i searched on how to divide home value for previously owned home, the articles all said the same thing. wasn’t supposed to be “weird” at all, just starting with the only info I could find. i want to be loving. i want you to be happy, not angry.
	10:06 PM	Jessica:	I can do the legal thing..... I REALLY don’t want to, as we discussed, silly to pay others to do the spreadsheets. M concern...you are working off a different unfair spreasheet.
	10:06 PM	Jason:	i just looked up attorneys within block of work that have free consults, so maybe can get a quick answer for cheap.
	10:13 PM	Jessica:	I meet with mine Tuesday, I’ll let you know what I find out compared to what I’ve been being told. by numerous professionals..obviously different from your google search. House 50/50..not sure why this is difficult..actually offended with everything I’ve put into this marriage, home everything..you want to knit pick a few years..once again...shows me your true character. I didn’t regret these years..now I’m worried you  are going to make that happen.
	10:15 PM	Jessica:	no, you’re not being loving..your last week has made that clear
	10:15 PM	Jason:	good gracious. i simply put down the best available information i could find expecting full well, if things went that route, adjustments would be made from there
	10:15 PM	Jessica:	I hope your new motorcycle is everything you wanted
	10:19 PM	Jessica:	no,those numbers were insulting...and you know it.. and if you honestly dont..that’s a whole other issue
	10:24 PM	Jessica:	really, 18k...the windows alone were more than that, this is the shit you are going to pull. I’ll give you my attorneys number this week. You are a self absorbed ass. Thanks for clearing everything up for me. No questions in my head any longer
	10:26 PM	Jason:	sheesh. those are just bank numbers. not sure where else to start except there. fully expect adjustments for sake of fairness once basic numbers are in place.
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	yeah..you arent even realistic with some numbers
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	45k in IRA
	10:30 PM	Jessica:	House..I can tell you exptecting to on low end 400k
	10:31 PM	Jason:	okay, will need to calculate 2007-18 difference, maybe factor in withdrawl penalties, add to sheet
	10:31 PM	Jason:	i’ll try to get that info
	10:31 PM	Jessica:	and PERSI
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure lawyer will have advise on avoiding fees
	10:34 PM	Jessica:	and what is split legally 50/50 in idaho
	10:51 PM	Jessica:	To bed for us. I was hoping to be amicable, you are proving that will most likely not be the case. I will get you my attorney’s number this week..we can go from there. I was hoping to use him just to cover our butts and help file paperwork, but looks like maybe not going to be that simple.
	10:52 PM	Jason:	sleep well. still not sure why you think adversarial. i truly did just copy down bank numbers and what the legal articles say for formulas. we’ll get it sorted.
	10:52 PM	Jessica:	I am horrifically sad...I thought we were better than this
	10:53 PM	Jason:	i don’t want this direction at all :(
	10:59 PM	Jessica:	there is now way you could put those numbers out and not be adversarial...but that is the issue, why I love you but can’t be married any longer..you don’t comprehend what’s wrong. How wrong you react to people...especially those that have had you’re back,...I could go on here, but seem pointless.
	11:01 PM	Jessica:	please get me the info I asked for, I’ll go from there
	11:05 PM	Jessica:	I wasn’t going to do the weird crazy garage breakout..I thought house lump sum made more sense..so all those line items were creepy..but whatever. Go plug in cameras, lenses, bags etc if that’s what your going for..you don’t get to pick and choose
	11:10 PM	Jason:	(cat unplugged internet) that too is just what the legal articles suggest. not trying to be weird or frustrating. even if value isn’t considered, can be useful to know who we expect to keep what. easy to work out later ...
	11:45 PM	Jessica:	I’ll give you more accurate numbers this week after I get the CMA and meet with my attorney

	4:15 PM	Jason:	Just walked in
	4:15 PM	Jason:	Upset
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	Oh no
	4:15 PM	Jason:	Biked home
	4:16 PM	Jason:	Says nobody was in culdesac

	4:16 PM	Jason:	Says definite no
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	Nope because Savanah and Mya weren’t going today and Piper’s mom messed up
	4:17 PM	Jason:	Oh, okay, so didn’t pull in there at all
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	nope
	5:11 PM	Jessica:	phew, just Laura on the uber.
	6:24 PM	Jason:	oh good (been out trying to make grill go after running out of the lighter fluid -- never works)
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	Put it on your grocery list. I am really digging the traeger. Didn’t know what the fuss was about until using a few times
	6:53 PM	Jason:	googling traeger
	6:54 PM	Jason:	oh, it’s a whole grill
	6:55 PM	Jessica:	Didn’t know about them until hearing guys at work getting excited when got one for auction
	6:56 PM	Jason:	pellet grill does seem simpler
	6:56 PM	Jason:	never liked the gas grill because it was always futzy
	6:59 PM	Jessica:	Good smoky flavor, not overwhelming
	7:01 PM	Jason:	Jealous
	7:01 PM	Jason:	Hunter wants to call
	7:02 PM	Jason:	I’ve been stalling him on answering request to play Xbox because making dinner, mowing, etc
	7:02 PM	Jason:	(He left his phone somewhere)
	7:07 PM	Jessica:	No Xbox. He can take it back with him to his dad’s..he did nothing he was supposed to. He can spend time on the things needed to stay before his flight on the 22nd.
	7:07 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:07 PM	Jason:	He doesn’t want to call you now
	7:08 PM	Jessica:	Shocking
	7:08 PM	Jason:	Yeah. Didn’t actually think that was the call reason. I’m naive.
	7:10 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure it was to ask for something...it always is.
	7:45 PM	Jason:	oh hail
	7:46 PM	Jessica:	Ummmm, salmon in the grill
	7:48 PM	Jessica:	Hail just hit
	8:00 PM	Jason:	don’t burn it
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	Dana got soaked rescuing it, all good
	8:41 PM	Jason:	Sounds amusing
	8:57 PM	Jessica:	Have Brenna call before she goes to bed please
	9:00 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:28 PM	Jason:	She’s just finishing up bath
	9:29 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:53 PM	Jason:	A mouse just ran over my foot 😳
	11:06 PM	Jessica:	Nooo way
	11:06 PM	Jessica:	Midget is back
	11:06 PM	Jason:	Apparently
	11:07 PM	Jessica:	Spaz has a friend
	11:07 PM	Jason:	Cat should make herself useful
	11:07 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s probably how it is
	11:07 PM	Jessica:	I was going to say she’s slacking, Lucas would never have allowed this
	11:07 PM	Jason:	Never
	11:08 PM	Jessica:	In the living room or your desk?
	11:08 PM	Jason:	While brushing
	11:08 PM	Jason:	Thought cat had sneaked in and was rubbing my foot
	11:08 PM	Jessica:	Ummmmm
	11:09 PM	Jason:	Looked down and saw mouse
	11:09 PM	Jason:	Charlotte died, btw
	11:10 PM	Jessica:	That’s horrific (mouse not cat) and I was also about to say now you have a huge spider and a mouse in there...time to burn it to the ground and start over,
	11:11 PM	Jessica:	mouse not spider, ugh
	11:11 PM	Jason:	It’s a zoo
	11:12 PM	Jessica:	So funny after so many years to have never seen one and now they have moved in. Where there is one...there is many
	11:13 PM	Jason:	Didn’t we decide it was Kayla’s boxes
	11:15 PM	Jessica:	Easy scapegoat...more likely Brenna/Hunter rooms
	11:15 PM	Jason:	Fair point
	11:16 PM	Jason:	Hundreds of mice could hide there
	11:16 PM	Jessica:	Exactly, Probably do need to get traps
	11:17 PM	Jessica:	Tell Brenna she got her new pet in exchange for guinea pig 😂
	11:17 PM	Jason:	Oh, good idea. I will.

	11:28 PM	Jason:	Don’t get me thinking about it 🐭
	11:29 PM	Jessica:	Right before bed, in the bathroom? 100 million percent I would be staying at a hotel...or up in Brenna’s bunk at least

	8:48 AM	Jessica:	already hit here, i got away with just accepting a doughnut hole
	8:49 AM	Jessica:	That is sad
	8:49 AM	Jessica:	I’m out of creamer :(
	8:49 AM	Jason:	i don’t think i’ve ever seen anyone here with treats
	8:49 AM	Jason:	come on over to floor 11 of banner, we’ve got creamer
	8:49 AM	Jessica:	funny, I think I may walk over to the district and get a real latte

	8:54 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:55 AM	Jason:	Secret place
	8:55 AM	Jason:	Still going to district?
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	nice, yeah in just a moment, almond latte sounds good
	8:57 AM	Jason:	Oh, okay, would have met you since I’m standing right here but should get back to work if you haven’t left
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	Just missed ya then
	9:05 AM	Jason:	Oh, would have waited if i thought you were that close. Sheesh. Had already been diddling around trying to figure out the bike locker, felt guilty.
	9:11 AM	Jason:	was dramatic getting brenna to bring gift to school today. she better have.
	9:12 AM	Jason:	“we can’t bring bags!"
	9:12 AM	Jason:	“okay, just carry it in a plastic bag that you throw away”

	9:14 AM	Jessica:	it was just a starbucks card right?
	9:18 AM	Jason:	yeah, and a bigger card she wrote in and envelope
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	oh jeez
	11:36 AM	Jason:	hopefully not our future https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/24/michael-rotondo-30-evicted-parents-explains-why-he-has-no-job/639948002/
	11:46 AM	Jessica:	That is insane. Yet I could see Hunter doing that 😬
	11:46 AM	Jessica:	I didn’t tell you what he called and asked me last night
	11:47 AM	Jason:	Oh?
	11:48 AM	Jason:	I let him go to Thornton’s to study since I generally consider him to be a good influence. He was back by 9ish with papers in hand so maybe studying really happened.
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	no, grades are already final, which is what I messaged him yesterday. I said at 6:10, “So looks like grades are final.  Are you going to do the 3 things needed to stay or stay with your dad?"
	11:50 AM	Jessica:	He called me a bit later and asked if he can do night classes next year instead of summer school to make up the classes....seriously
	11:50 AM	Jason:	anything to put things off for his imaginary future self to do
	11:51 AM	Jason:	checked his grades this morning. surprised at what he passed, actually.
	11:53 AM	Jessica:	I told him he would need to do the research and work to put a plan together to show me and do all the leg work. He said I can’t sign up without your signature. I said no, not sign up, put the information together and present it to me AFTER you do the other two things required. Get a job lined up and meeting with the seargeant to review enlistment options.
	11:53 AM	Jessica:	I just looked, yeah he had an F in US History last night, they were generous
	11:54 AM	Jessica:	how the heck do you get a 65 on a pe test?
	11:54 AM	Jason:	who knows. or less than full credit in a study hour?
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	I just can’t even
	11:57 AM	Jason:	i know. his behavior is so far removed from our own at that age, it’s really hard to comprehend, let alone empathize
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I think as we’ve said it’s going to take him longer to mature and have some real like consequences. I think the only way for him to not be on that path is enlisting, giving him the time and structure to mature.
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	life
	12:00 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	So next year from what I can tell he needs: semester of English 10, Speech, semester of Biology, full year of English 12, and a semester of American Government.
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:22 PM	Jason:	steep climb
	12:22 PM	Jessica:	for him yes...he didn’t even need PE this semester
	12:23 PM	Jason:	let alone the free periods
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	exactly, and even with that schedule he would have plenty of free periods next year..just all classes he seriously struggles in
	12:26 PM	Jason:	he definitely needs to knock out a couple over the summer for realistic hope
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	yep
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Brenna very amused
	3:12 PM	Jason:	ha, very nice :)
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	Hunter with Hayden, Dallas and the boys. Swimming, dinner etc. I told him to check in and let me know where he’s staying
	8:51 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:51 PM	Jason:	Slumber party in full swing here
	8:51 PM	Jason:	And beer drinking
	8:52 PM	Jessica:	sorry, didn’t mean to leave you with that. If the girls didn’t have to be back so early they would have stayed here.
	8:52 PM	Jason:	no worries :)
	8:52 PM	Jessica:	I told them to enjoy two nights to themselves since I have them tomorrow
	8:54 PM	Jessica:	They were busy watching bunnies in the backyard..and super excited about it
	8:54 PM	Jason:	that’s pretty funny
	8:54 PM	Jason:	not sure what to do with themselves
	8:55 PM	Jessica:	He said he purposely hasn’t mowed for the bunnies..and they got bunny food...it’s serious
	8:55 PM	Jason:	Oh wow. Soon it will be them versus Bill for animal hospitality.
	8:55 PM	Jessica:	I did mention Bill started the feeding/breeding frenzy
	8:58 PM	Jason:	waiting for herd of deer to start living in his yard
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	would not be shocking
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	We win
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:47 PM	Jason:	You’ve been busy! Nice work.
	9:54 PM	Jessica:	Heads up, Hunter asked to have him and JJ, Conor, Hayden, Dallas stay. I said absolutely not. I don’t think friends allowed at either place
	9:54 PM	Jason:	Agreed. No way here. Doubly so with girls here.
	9:57 PM	Jason:	Worried now they’ll try to show up after we’ve gone to bed. If no plan for them to stay here, I’ll lock down.
	9:59 PM	Jessica:	Lock down. I’m going to message him now on his plans so I know where he is.
	9:59 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:59 PM	Jason:	Initiating lock-down [sci-fi sounds]
	10:02 PM	Jessica:	Staying at Hayden’s. Lock down here as well. The dogs make it easier
	10:05 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Saturday, June 2, 2018

	9:18 AM	Jessica:	Brenna wants me to come get her at 10. If I do would you be willing to take her to gymnastics at 1? I can drop her back on way to bbq.
	9:19 AM	Jason:	Sure
	9:21 AM	Jessica:	Thanks that will save me one back and forth between 5oclock pick up and the morning ones
	9:21 AM	Jason:	No problem. I have no plans today other than little chores. Certainly not some big yard prune.
	9:23 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, that’s pretty much my weekend other than running Brenna around....and finding waterfall leak 😜
	9:24 AM	Jason:	what?! i’d say i know someone who’s a leak expert except there’s no way to become an expert because they’re all different
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	Seem to know about where it is, lots of rocks still not laid, hopefully I get lucky
	9:27 AM	Jason:	it does help that the waterfall liner is still largely exposed. shouldn’t be too hard to find.
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	exactly
	9:43 AM	Jessica:	I’m going to hurt your child
	9:44 AM	Jason:	she won’t talk to me now

	9:51 AM	Jessica:	It was at 8:45
	9:52 AM	Jason:	Okay, I was reading. Heard noise but thought it was cat.
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	I’ll touch base with you later, I have class 10:30-11:30 so if you are going to be at the gym may have you grab her while I run home, clean myself up for the bbq and grab her something to change into for the bbq, then won’t be as late
	9:54 AM	Jessica:	since I can’t keep my schedule straight obviously
	9:54 AM	Jason:	:) no problem
	9:54 AM	Jason:	she’s done at noon?

	9:57 AM	Jason:	of course :)
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	Heads up, I left Taylor my card for my piece unique account that was paid off, but used for Brenna’s shoes. Looks like Alex didn’t get it and ran it through billing. I messaged her to get rid of that card number. Just for when you see a 50 piece unique transaction

	12:01 PM	Jessica:	Asking me for money to get a sandwich.. I’m ignoring him

	12:02 PM	Jason:	We have sandwich stuff. Maybe I’ll grill.

	1:13 PM	Jessica:	Ummm, yeah I looked back there to see if he was in the hammock
	1:13 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, she’s good now

	11:16 AM	Jason:	brenna cool as a cucumber, as usual. and scowling at me, as usual.

	1:10 PM	Jessica:	nope, I messaged and called, no response. almost ran by when I dropped Brenna at Piper’s but wasn’t in the mood for any battle or stinky room
	1:10 PM	Jessica:	or being asked for money
	1:29 PM	Jason:	understood
	5:47 PM	Jessica:	I told him he needs to let us know by 10 where he is at and plans so we know when to lock up. Also reminder on his activities needed. He got the srgnt number from me again, we shall see

	7:03 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	7:03 PM	Jason:	wild afternoon
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	Sounds like it
	7:48 PM	Jessica:	When you have some time, let’s chat about making some adjustments with Brenna and the schedule so I’m not at opposite weeks when gone. Maybe we split up a week to make it work? Flexible. Just let me know your schedule/thoughts
	8:16 PM	Jason:	the calendar seems to have everything. switching mid-week is fine. anything is fine, really, as long as she has regular time with us both
	8:16 PM	Jason:	your sister trip and wallowa mean i’ll have her for ten or eleven days
	8:45 PM	Jessica:	yeah, that’s why I wanted to switch it up a bit. The schedule right now falls on both trips for me since we started on your work trip. I’ll look shortly and propose some days. Hauling crap currently. Do you have your brother ride nailed down?
	8:46 PM	Jason:	Not totally but some approx dates are in there

	2:59 PM	Jason:	i expect hunter will be thrilled
	3:02 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, Hunter mad. He is trying to get an appt with the sgnt this week and following up on a couple job leads. I said if he gets the appt set and has a job lined up, even if he has to finish lining it up from there I’ll book his flight in two weeks, but not if he hasn’t made effort to do those things.
	3:08 PM	Jason:	yeah, not like he hasn’t had months and gobs of free time to take care of these things

	5:45 PM	Jessica:	It’s cool
	8:56 PM	Jessica:	When Brenna and Piper  just have  them both dropped of by Aaron here and then ask to get ahold of Piper’s mom for a sleepover 🤔🤨
	9:39 PM	Jason:	Not good planning on their part
	9:40 PM	Jason:	Or maybe perfect planning 😜
	9:40 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, she was told never to pull that again or she’d be grounded and lose electronics after I brought her friend home
	9:41 PM	Jessica:	Hunter staying at Hayden’s most likely. Reminded him to have room cleaned before Saturday
	9:41 PM	Jessica:	😂😂
	9:42 PM	Jason:	Funny indeed

	5:18 PM	Jessica:	Jeez

	5:19 PM	Jason:	“you’re taller” the boy said to her
	5:47 PM	Jason:	hunter arrived
	5:47 PM	Jessica:	Good, I had Hayden send out a message to all his friends
	5:49 PM	Jason:	pulling out all the stops 😬
	5:49 PM	Jessica:	Yep... pissed

	9:55 PM	Jason:	going for the slovenly gold medal
	9:55 PM	Jessica:	He wanted me to call scott and have his phone turned back on. Said no, said well you don’t pay for it

	8:59 AM	Jason:	i’ll miss the bike parking here.
	8:59 AM	Jason:	people frowned at me when i put my bike in the elevator to bring up over there
	9:00 AM	Jason:	get concrete patched?
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	We did the first layer, she now knows how to mix and get the right consistency now so I think she is finishing today.
	9:05 AM	Jason:	sounds like countertops
	9:05 AM	Jason:	you’re a slave driver
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	Why did you bring your bike up rather than the bike parking?
	9:05 AM	Jason:	no bike parking at other building
	9:06 AM	Jason:	building that as part of our move-in
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	gotcha
	9:06 AM	Jason:	already knew that wouldn’t be ready for move-in, though; told we could park bikes at our desks
	9:06 AM	Jason:	floor will be big wide open space so looking forward to riding over to snacks and back
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	oh jeez
	9:11 AM	Jason:	you gotta feel good about all you got done
	9:16 AM	Jason:	i assume the calendar is correct for brenna’s gymnastics days/times ...
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	yep, 2:30-6:30 M-T-Thur
	9:20 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	I need to send a check with Brenna today for Top Flight. I think we decided to take from billing and the extra from mine will cover? I will drop a check at the house for her to turn into the office, it was due Friday.
	10:12 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:20 AM	Jessica:	does AJ have a cell# ?

	11:20 AM	Jason:	I’ve been texting with her
	11:21 AM	Jessica:	okay, I need to let her know the check is on the counter Brenna needs to take with her today and turn into the office
	11:25 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	I messaged her.
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	ho;y crap I’m already wishing it was Friday!
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	holy

	1:47 PM	Jason:	yeah, that works. thanks for arranging.
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	no problem, I would have you arrange but between the three of us it gets confusing as it is and Deb usually has a whole other conversation happening within the message thread. Easier to just speak for the both of us and arrange who is doing what portion between us.
	1:54 PM	Jason:	yeah, that makes sense
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	AJ knows to have Brenna be ready at 2 for pick up right?
	1:55 PM	Jason:	Yeah. I’ll remind her this first time, though.
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

	8:58 PM	Jason:	I guess I should try begging
	9:14 PM	Jessica:	Smart ass

	8:32 AM	Jason:	Didn’t miss much with Wrinkle in Time
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Oh bummer, it looked good
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	Can you take Thursday rather than pick up tonight? Surprise, surprise Lee committed to taking and needs to switch
	9:09 AM	Jason:	yep, that’s fine. i’ll need piper’s address before then, i guess
	9:10 AM	Jason:	It was kind of good. Graphics looked like video game in many parts (if you know what i mean) and jumped around too much to feel invested in characters IMHO :)
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	so they tried to hard and ruined it
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	what is IMHO
	9:14 AM	Jason:	in my humble opinion
	9:24 AM	Jessica:	😁
	9:55 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:04 AM	Jessica:	Hopefully you get one here
	12:08 PM	Jason:	listening to our two early 20-something devs talk about how dumb they feel doing “real” programming
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	😂😂
	1:01 PM	Jason:	moving soon
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	Just done with staff lunch for the full time trainees...we had 4 interns flip to full time so a younger group than normal for a full time class
	1:05 PM	Jason:	you’re putting up with 20-somethings too
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	yep
	1:06 PM	Jason:	my joke with them is anything mentioned from the past, I start in “stamps were little stickers were used to put on envelopes to send messages” ... or whatever the thing is
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	that is awesome
	1:07 PM	Jason:	“modems were ... "; “boomboxes were”; try to do it once a day
	1:08 PM	Jason:	not sure why they feel dumb, though
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	good question
	2:35 PM	Jessica:	Brenna will get dropped off a bit later tonight because they have their leotard fitting after practice
	2:35 PM	Jason:	okay, good to know, especially since she wants to grill. thanks.
	2:36 PM	Jessica:	yep
	3:41 PM	Jason:	moving time. come over if you want to carry some monitors.
	3:49 PM	Jessica:	Sure...in heels
	4:03 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:03 PM	Jason:	Steeling tables
	4:46 PM	Jason:	All moved
	4:54 PM	Jason:	Damn. Returned key before I got my bike.
	4:55 PM	Jason:	Waiting for someone to happen along
	5:01 PM	Jessica:	Oh crap
	5:01 PM	Jason:	Still waiting
	5:01 PM	Jason:	Surely someone uses this besides me
	5:02 PM	Jessica:	Nobody in building I ask?
	5:02 PM	Jessica:	To
	5:02 PM	Jason:	She was gathering up to leave
	5:03 PM	Jason:	I’ll wait a while longer
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	I’m at whole foods then running to a rotary thing. If your stuck let me know and I’ll grab you
	5:04 PM	Jason:	Thanks
	5:11 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	5:12 PM	Jessica:	Success!
	5:35 PM	Jason:	Phew 😛
	9:03 PM	Jessica:	Let Brenna know she has a next Thursday hair appointment
	9:03 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:04 PM	Jason:	How was rotary?
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	It was a wine tasting/changing of president bbq
	9:04 PM	Jason:	Nice
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	Good, I snuck out early. Have to be at work early
	9:05 PM	Jason:	But no one to take your job yet?
	9:05 PM	Jessica:	Yes...looks like possibly 😁
	9:06 PM	Jason:	Woo boo
	9:06 PM	Jason:	Hoo
	9:06 PM	Jason:	Who the hell says woo boo, autocorrect

Wednesday, June 13, 2018

	11:25 AM	Jason:	I think I mentioned I’d started changing the payment account on some bills to my separate account. Just reminding me since you’ll see me move some money to my account as I see those bills coming. It’s a little tricky since some take an extra cycle before they swtich and some are right away.
	11:25 AM	Jason:	*reminding you
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	ok
	11:26 AM	Jessica:	all moved to the new building?
	11:30 AM	Jason:	yep. all settled in. went to trader joes this morning for snacks.
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	nice!
	11:33 AM	Jason:	on 13th floor which was a law firm
	11:34 AM	Jason:	we’re in a room that was for practice court. it has a judge’s bench
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	That’s funny. Window view?
	11:34 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:34 AM	Jason:	Godammit
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	Everything not remodelled yet?
	11:34 AM	Jason:	Not yet
	11:34 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:35 AM	Jessica:	Have you guys been playing with it?
	11:35 AM	Jason:	we encourage kristi to sit there and judge us
	11:35 AM	Jason:	lots of jokes, of course
	11:35 AM	Jason:	if we disagree with QA
	11:35 AM	Jason:	“approach the bench!"
	11:35 AM	Jason:	on and on
	11:36 AM	Jason:	“objection!"
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	I bet..... just to easy

	11:48 AM	Jessica:	Looks roomier
	11:59 AM	Jason:	yeah, room for everyone now
	11:59 AM	Jason:	a little awkward bringing my bike in the elevator
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	When are they building that?
	12:08 PM	Jason:	the bike parking? not sure. we were told we could park our bikes by our desks for a while even when we get our actual office space
	3:22 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:22 PM	Jason:	Lounge
	3:40 PM	Jessica:	Quite the set up
	3:40 PM	Jason:	need to bring in a bottle of whiskey
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	You have a flask
	3:47 PM	Jason:	better idea, yes
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Would you take a look when you are home and see if I left some checks to my account on the counter. I just printed the one sheet when I did the check for Brenna’s top flight camp and can’t find them. Thinking I left them there, want to make sure I didn’t leave them floating around.
	4:19 PM	Jason:	I think I noticed them when I fed the cat this morning sitting on the white corner shelves where the cat food is.
	4:19 PM	Jason:	There was a reddish pen sitting with them
	4:27 PM	Jason:	bike time
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	oh good, I didn’t leave them somewhere
	5:34 PM	Jason:	nope, they’re safe, unless the cat decides to do something with them
	9:56 PM	Jessica:	Brenna available or are you guys watching a movie?
	9:57 PM	Jason:	She’s on her phone right now
	9:57 PM	Jason:	We had snow cones
	10:06 PM	Jessica:	I’m not sure how much $ AJ is making taking her to do stuff every day😂
	10:07 PM	Jason:	I know, I’ve talked to her about it twice and mentioned it to Christi when I helped them move a retailer earlier
	10:07 PM	Jason:	They all seem happy with it
	10:07 PM	Jason:	*trailer
	10:08 PM	Jessica:	Okay, just want it to be worth her time.
	10:09 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I was concerned she felt obligated but seems to be what she wants
	10:09 PM	Jessica:	Glad they’re having fun
	10:09 PM	Jason:	Yeah, me too
	10:10 PM	Jason:	Though brenna was quite moody when they got back today but told me angrily that she wasn’t angry 🤔
	10:11 PM	Jason:	Normal ten year old stuff I guess
	10:13 PM	Jessica:	Of course
	10:13 PM	Jessica:	She’s only getting moodier from here
	10:14 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	10:15 PM	Jessica:	😜
	10:23 PM	Jessica:	Piper’s address: 2801 Honeycomb Way. Harris ranch
	10:23 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:24 PM	Jason:	What time do you get Brenna to make the whole pickup circuit
	10:24 PM	Jason:	?
	10:25 PM	Jessica:	1:45, get Piper, then cut across to get Mya
	10:25 PM	Jason:	Thanks
	10:26 PM	Jessica:	She said she spent 5 hours cleaning her room....
	10:27 PM	Jessica:	I told her to clean her bathroom tomorrow
	10:27 PM	Jason:	She was still cleaning when I went to bed

	11:01 AM	Jason:	yeah
	11:01 AM	Jason:	should just be a few dollars
	11:01 AM	Jessica:	$#@!
	11:01 AM	Jason:	seems like we replaced it once already
	11:01 AM	Jessica:	That’s what I thought
	11:02 AM	Jessica:	Another task to my growing list
	11:02 AM	Jason:	hustle up 😛
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	successful gymnastics run?
	4:10 PM	Jason:	Oops, missed that. Yep, no problems.

	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	4:18 PM	Jason:	nice job :)
	5:21 PM	Jessica:	Great!  Also we have 2 tennis racquets already... if you guys have a few that would be great so we could play doubles:). She will need swimsuit as well as clothing for a day hike perhaps.  A jacket and something warm for a cooler day on Saturday. Thanks Jessica!
	5:21 PM	Jessica:	Packing list
	5:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:01 PM	Jason:	Waiting for brenna

Friday, June 15, 2018

	8:03 AM	Jason:	Brenna rash off her legs but now on her cheeks a bit
	8:04 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:10 AM	Jessica:	Oh no, wonder what she reacted to. Have her take a Benadryl. The fact the other went away is a good sign
	8:16 AM	Jessica:	Does it itch?
	8:36 AM	Jason:	I don’t think so. She didn’t seem worried about it. I’m at work now but told her to call either one of us if she has any worries, which I know she wouldn’t hesitate to do.
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	8:50 AM	Jason:	We went to Tavern last night. She’s so reticent to say exactly what she wants sometimes. Just grumps.
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, she has been moodier lately.. I notice she does it way more to you
	9:14 AM	Jessica:	I think she likes trying to get a reaction out of you 😂
	9:15 AM	Jason:	I’m sure. She’s an expert.
	9:16 AM	Jessica:	She definitely has last child syndrome.
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	where is your key to the office? Brenna needs paper
	9:34 AM	Jason:	topmost white corner shelves, left edge
	9:34 AM	Jason:	she’ll have to climb a bit
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	told her to grab a stool, video chatting so I could help her find the right allery meds
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	allergy
	9:38 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:39 AM	Jessica:	keys returned, cat no longer locked in there
	9:41 AM	Jason:	:) she always tries to run in there when i go in too
	9:42 AM	Jason:	locking obviously unimportant while hunter away
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	She’s making me stay on video with ehr while I work and she’s doing her project
	9:48 AM	Jason:	what’s her project?
	9:48 AM	Jessica:	can’t tell you
	9:49 AM	Jason:	oh, i see
	9:49 AM	Jason:	she’s about out of time
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	yep
	10:21 AM	Jessica:	Off she goes
	10:23 AM	Jason:	fun for her :)
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	yeah, jealous. I just get to work
	1:24 PM	Jessica:	I did a cashiers check from billing for 208 for my russian visa. Wasn’t sure if it was okay like that or if you want me to transfer over from line. There is the extra 444 this month with 325 of that allocated to top flight, the rest can go towards and then remainder take from my distribution next week, unless you want to do something different
	1:25 PM	Jason:	that seems fine. sounds like only $100 or less over budget
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:27 PM	Jessica:	what is the form about for top flight? Brenna wanted me to take care of it, didn’t want me to talk to you about it...was being weird
	1:43 PM	Jason:	she’s a turkey. form due today. glad you reminded me, actually. i filled it out and took a picture to send to wings.
	1:43 PM	Jason:	she was all adamant i couldn’t do it that way.
	1:43 PM	Jason:	do you have a good wings e-mail? if not, i probably have one in my inbox somewhere
	1:44 PM	Jessica:	ahh, gotcha. I was going to have Amber email me it if needed. gymnastics@wingscenter.com
	1:45 PM	Jason:	got it. i’ll send the forms and cc you.
	1:54 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:54 PM	Jason:	Fixed
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez
	2:00 PM	Jason:	someone else brought it
	2:00 PM	Jason:	not the best but will probably seem better soon
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	I find that usually true with alchohol
	2:01 PM	Jason:	true that
	3:37 PM	Jessica:	So...may need to use AJ more
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	if she’s available
	3:38 PM	Jason:	Dana won’t be available?
	3:38 PM	Jason:	i bet she is
	3:39 PM	Jessica:	Nope, she just got the job she was after awhile ago. They finally had a project start they wanted her on. She leaves Sunday for training in Philadelphia and though this will be home base, she will travel a lot
	3:39 PM	Jessica:	she’s gone for two weeks to start
	3:40 PM	Jason:	we can see people using the JUMP slide now
	3:40 PM	Jason:	i suggested we go squirt some baby oil at the top
	3:41 PM	Jessica:	I want to use the JUMP slide 😂
	3:41 PM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	3:56 PM	Jason:	whiskey is making us all funny
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	oh boy....
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	a room of drunk engineers...not sure what that looks like
	3:59 PM	Jason:	the best jokes
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	please don’t tell me you’ve told your jokes
	4:14 PM	Jason:	working up to it
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	Bike home safely
	4:14 PM	Jason:	motorcycle is fixed. maybe a ride tomorrow? open until 6:00 tonight but hard to get out there in rush hour.
	4:15 PM	Jason:	can always uber if you’re busy
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Yeah tomorrow good, still working, have to help Dana with planning tonight and coordination of our schedules with the dogs , she’s freaking out
	4:17 PM	Jason:	🐕🐩🐶
	4:18 PM	Jason:	that’s all i got
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Oh boy, how much whiskey has happened
	4:18 PM	Jason:	finishing second glass, not much
	4:18 PM	Jason:	brad couldn’t find glass so filled a vase half-way
	4:18 PM	Jason:	(brad not on our direct team but sitting in our area)
	4:19 PM	Jessica:	Please tell me you’re joking
	4:19 PM	Jason:	i don’t joke about whiskey consumption
	4:19 PM	Jason:	only about strawberries and grapes
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a GIF from Tenor GIF Keyboard.
	9:57 PM	Jessica:	Did you message AJ or should I?
	9:59 PM	Jason:	I haven’t. Figured there would be extra details you’d want to share like pickup / drop off times.
	10:00 PM	Jessica:	Okay, I will talk with her tomorrow
	10:09 PM	Jessica:	Also, Terry and Tracy will be there for Hunter swearing in
	10:09 PM	Jason:	Nice!
	10:10 PM	Jessica:	I’m pissed I can’t be there
	10:11 PM	Jason:	🙁 we’ll get video
	10:12 PM	Jason:	And if all goes as usual, he’ll have pissed you off by then 😂
	10:15 PM	Jessica:	Not really sure how to respond to that, considering he’s taking advantage of being there as he pleases
	10:16 PM	Jason:	Just that it’s always nice to see hunter and also nice to get a break after a while
	10:26 PM	Jessica:	You realize that was an asshole thing to say right?
	10:27 PM	Jason:	No
	10:28 PM	Jason:	We’ve both said that many times over the years of his comings and goings
	10:56 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:57 PM	Jessica:	Not what I meant to post, just picked up my phone and it hit that

Saturday, June 16, 2018

	9:59 AM	Jessica:	You missed a call from Jessica.
	3:05 PM	Jason:	I’m going to ride up Blacks Creek to Prairie then back down along Arrowrock (maybe a stop at the Lava Ridge trailhead) ... just so someone knows.
	3:13 PM	Jessica:	Thank you. I appreciate knowing where you’re going when motorcycling alone😜
	3:13 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	10:01 PM	Jessica:	Yes, why??
	10:02 PM	Jason:	I hurt my ankle. I just need to get around the house until it feels better. Hurts too much to step on. I can wait until tomorrow.
	10:02 PM	Jessica:	Holy crap, morning okay?
	10:03 PM	Jason:	yeah. thanks.
	10:03 PM	Jason:	whenever brenna gets here, presumably
	10:04 PM	Jessica:	Okay, ice it
	10:05 PM	Jason:	I will when the ice packs I bought are frozen again. Found both in Hunter’s room.
	10:07 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:28 PM	Jessica:	Looks dusty
	10:29 PM	Jason:	it rained on me up there so not too bad dust-wise
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	Uh oh
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	Which ankle?
	10:29 PM	Jason:	right
	10:30 PM	Jason:	feels like top of foot, actually. felt like i broke it. caught on stump. almost turned back but had some rootbeer from y-stop instead.
	10:31 PM	Jason:	hurt so much i felt nauseous but settled down after a few minutes so decided to continue
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Well damn it
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Dr Monday
	10:32 PM	Jason:	i hope it just gets better overnight

Sunday, June 17, 2018

	8:53 AM	Jessica:	How’s it feel?
	8:53 AM	Jason:	Haven’t put weight on it yet
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Still hurts to move it
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Not good.
	8:54 AM	Jason:	I can wiggle all my toes, though
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	8:55 AM	Jason:	They’re handsome toes
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	I’ll bring them by in a bit. They haven’t left McCall yet. I have to go grab a few things to send with Eric and them to Kayla so will get that out of the way
	9:34 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:35 AM	Jason:	Showering. Planning most efficient ways to walk in house 😄
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	Be there a few minutes
	9:37 AM	Jason:	door’s open
	12:17 PM	Jessica:	Running to house to switch laundry
	12:17 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:24 PM	Jason:	i feel like firebread if that sounds okay
	12:25 PM	Jessica:	Firebread or flat bread?
	12:25 PM	Jason:	whatever one is in bown
	12:25 PM	Jessica:	Flat bread😂
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	Is Brenna home yet? Thinking I’ll just wait here to take Dana to the airport in about 45 minutes rather than run back and forth
	12:27 PM	Jason:	makes sense. yeah, she’s here.
	12:27 PM	Jessica:	Did you want to go there to eat or me pick it up?
	12:28 PM	Jason:	there to eat
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:47 PM	Jessica:	Hope you had a good Father’s day.   Ice, elevate, bed
	7:47 PM	Jason:	Yes. Thank you. 😀
	7:48 PM	Jessica:	Reminder: pizza in the fridge
	8:23 PM	Jason:	woo hoo. I was listening to This American Life. And by “listening” I mean falling-asleep-to.
	8:26 PM	Jessica:	Early bedtime probably good
	9:42 PM	Jessica:	Guess who has his phone back on
	9:43 PM	Jason:	mmmm
	9:43 PM	Jessica:	And was taken shopping for a few hundred in clothes
	9:43 PM	Jason:	oh jeez. i hope he doesn’t bring them back. sooo many clothes.
	9:44 PM	Jessica:	And Scott plans on Hunter being back after July 2nd swearing in
	9:44 PM	Jessica:	I seriously give up
	9:44 PM	Jason:	that will be a challenge. he might as well drive over for the swearing and drive back with him
	9:45 PM	Jason:	well, if he gets sworn in then others will be taking over the accountabiilty
	9:45 PM	Jessica:	Hunter doesn’t plan on going back. I think he has to start drills
	9:45 PM	Jason:	oh. well, they better get that sorted.
	9:45 PM	Jessica:	I told Hunter to talk with him... I’m done
	9:46 PM	Jason:	exactly. shouldn’t be your problem to sort at this point. he’s grown up.
	11:06 PM	Jason:	Thinking I might sleep in so may still be here if you’re planning to drop Brenna
	11:08 PM	Jessica:	Brenna not with AJ tomorrow. M going in a bit later, home at lunch, taking to gymnastics.
	11:08 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:09 PM	Jason:	Sleep well

Monday, June 18, 2018

	9:42 AM	Jessica:	I don’t need to go Friday, and it looks like his signing won’t be the 2nd, will be around 15th-20th so that works out better
	9:43 AM	Jason:	So he’ll stay longer with Scott?
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	He plans on coming back Friday. He doesn’t want to stay longer, Scott seems to think he will be back after signing. Like I said, I’m done figuring it out. He can speak with his dad and have that battle, I’m done communicating with Scott as he does whatever he wants anyway. I just wanted him signed.
	9:47 AM	Jessica:	Sergeant Parker bringing him back Friday once he has Scott sign paperwork
	9:48 AM	Jason:	Ah, okay. Yep, that’s fair.
	9:49 AM	Jason:	foot news: a little fatter and random blue areas
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	Keeping it elevated?
	9:49 AM	Jason:	usually, yep
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:54 AM	Jessica:	so far I think I have gymnastics covered so you don’t have to drive this week
	9:55 AM	Jason:	woah. that’s like magic. you have powers. perhaps from the darkside but i’ll take it.
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	smart ass
	3:44 PM	Jessica:	Make it into work or work from home all day? Any less painful?
	3:45 PM	Jason:	Came in. A bit less painful. Drove but I don’t think I’ll do that again. Walking the two blocks sucked. I think being able to bike right to the door will be nicer.
	3:46 PM	Jason:	Monday treating you okay?
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	Oh no, yeah walking a ways not good
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	Insane Monday
	4:06 PM	Jason:	the usual then ... :(
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	4:06 PM	Jason:	two new guys today. harassed them a bit.
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	Of course you did
	4:06 PM	Jason:	out of space so jeff sat up iun judges bench
	4:06 PM	Jason:	we have a gavel now
	4:06 PM	Jason:	and defendant/plaintiff placards
	8:12 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully you are iced and elevated
	8:12 PM	Jason:	Close. Elevated with cold beer.
	8:13 PM	Jessica:	Was today difficult?
	8:14 PM	Jason:	Parking garage walk was harder than I expected. Sitting at work was fine. Seems a little better this evening.
	8:15 PM	Jason:	Staying off it. Dirty dishes and long grass. 😱
	8:15 PM	Jason:	Survived ‘
	8:15 PM	Jessica:	You’ll live, leave it
	8:15 PM	Jason:	Survived Monday?
	8:16 PM	Jessica:	Nope, but I’ll keep plugging along
	8:16 PM	Jason:	Ah hell
	8:21 PM	Jessica:	It’s going to be that way for awhile... I’m adjusting
	8:22 PM	Jason:	You’re not getting an assistant anytime soon?
	8:22 PM	Jessica:	Getting there
	8:23 PM	Jessica:	I have to pass my test to have the leverage
	8:24 PM	Jason:	When is the next test date?
	8:25 PM	Jessica:	Monday
	8:25 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Tuesday, June 19, 2018

	8:32 AM	Jason:	oh no. no coffee.
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Uh oh....
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	did you try biking?
	8:47 AM	Jason:	yeah. biking was fine. better than walking two blocks from garage. now i just need to walk over to coffee shop.
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	at least it’s across the street :)
	8:52 AM	Jason:	yeah. mostly an elevator ride.
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	DMV success
	11:55 AM	Jason:	woah
	11:55 AM	Jason:	well done. any hassle?
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Nope
	11:59 AM	Jason:	that’s cool. a relief.
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	Very, since I don’t even have my passport
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	When you can, the paperwork for dissolution is ready at the lawyers. They just need you to run by and sign the acceptance of service. Made more sense then the whole “being served thing” which feels icky to me. I will forward you the assistants information that has location information and copy of paperwork.
	1:21 PM	Jason:	okay :(
	1:23 PM	Jessica:	I know, this is not easy at all. I’ve spent days crying over it. I desperately want to salvage the good things we have between us. I just know the marriage part has not been us at our best, and I want to heal and hang on to the parts that haven’t been painful.
	2:49 PM	Jessica:	you changed the banking password?
	3:06 PM	Jessica:	?
	3:07 PM	Jason:	for my login, yeah. did you need access to other accounts? this all has to be separated soon. i’ll close the billing account when stuff is transitioned. is there an account you need access to?
	3:14 PM	Jessica:	Yes and it will, but until those things are agreed and settled upon I need all the same access
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	I find it interesting that was your first move in under minutes of my message, so much for trying to be amicable and non combative
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	I’m pretty sure that was also clear in the paperwork
	3:31 PM	Jason:	i’m not trying to be combative. i can go to the bank and sign off to have whatever accounts are missing start showing up for you. is it the mortgage and credit line?
	3:33 PM	Jessica:	yes, jeep, savings, hunter accnt as well....and that you don’t understand that was combative is exactly why we are here
	3:34 PM	Jason:	i already signed for you to have hunter acct access. jeep will be paid off after this month but can add you. i’ll do that today or tomorrow.
	3:34 PM	Jessica:	no, when i was in there wasn’t for hunter awhile ago
	3:35 PM	Jason:	i’ll check again. i specifically went in for that. they said you just needed to go in and sign the thing too.
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	I was going to suggest as we try agreeing on things (which I see as a possible problem) That we try using this person. He’s been mentioned to me numerous times as a lifesaver in helping the process be amicable and a few people have said it changed the divorce from ugly to mutually helpful. Something to think about
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	https://www.boisemediation.com/
	3:46 PM	Jason:	I’ll check it out
	3:46 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Thursday, June 21, 2018

	9:41 AM	Jessica:	Are you going to go by and get the papers signed?
	9:41 AM	Jason:	yep, planning to tomorrow midday
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	how’s your foor?
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	foot
	9:45 AM	Jason:	about 80% better. considered mowing but think i’ll give it another day
	9:45 AM	Jason:	how’s test prep?
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	yeah, don’t push it
	9:45 AM	Jason:	(toes still alternating colors of blue as stuff works out, i guess)
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	Stressful. Started yesterday, working from home to study.
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	keep icing it probably
	12:11 PM	Jessica:	Chop chop
	12:11 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:11 PM	Jason:	oh boy. she looks pretty serious. :)
	12:15 PM	Jessica:	Oh.. She’s been very clear on what she wants
	12:16 PM	Jason:	of course :)
	12:35 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:35 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:36 PM	Jason:	she looks pretty happy
	12:37 PM	Jessica:	Can’t stop looking at it
	12:42 PM	Jason:	that’s a good sign
	12:43 PM	Jason:	unless it doesn’t stop
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	Brenna doesn’t like any of her leotards here so we are swinging by the house to grab a different one on the way, door unlocked?
	1:38 PM	Jason:	yep
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Friday, June 22, 2018

	9:18 AM	Jessica:	Bringing Brenna to Melissa’s in a bit. I think they are biking today. I am going into lockdown mode after that through the weekend to study for exam. When Hunter is back this afternoon I was going to have him go there with no going anywhere until the room is cleaned as told it needed to be and how he said it was. I will review the rules with him. No going anywhere if things not clean, check in at 10pm, curfew 12. I’m fine with him there this weekend while I’m in study mode but would like him here this coming week more. I’ll address with him. Would like to have them m,t,wed or t, wed, thur before I leave Saturday at the butt crack of dawn
	9:54 AM	Jessica:	and Nick’s shoes fit :)
	10:20 AM	Jason:	glad the shoes fit :) that was much faster than sending postal.
	10:21 AM	Jason:	other plans sound good. good luck with studying.
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	Thank god, Scott signed off on his application
	2:13 PM	Jason:	Yea. Step 1.
	2:18 PM	Jessica:	🙏
	2:40 PM	Jason:	is that prayers or claps?
	2:41 PM	Jessica:	Praying.. That the rest gets done
	2:42 PM	Jason:	😅👍
	3:49 PM	Jessica:	Hunter conversation fyi:
	3:49 PM	Jessica:	When you get to the house first thing is to clean your room as it was supposed to be. You go nowhere until it’s been done and Jason has checked it. Rules are go nowhere unless room cleaned, check in by 10pm, curfew 12
	3:49 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:49 PM	Jessica:	I thought you cleaned it you saud you were
	3:49 PM	Jessica:	No, I’ve been busy and it’s you’re responsibility
	3:50 PM	Jason:	yeah, jeez. he’s only 17
	3:50 PM	Jason:	*your ;)
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	I am studying for my exam this weekend so please be responsible
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	Ill try to and i need you to make up an excuse for dad so i dont have to go back there he thinks hes gonna fly me back there
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	Not try..do. this is ridiculous. We’ll discuss the dad thing later..when you show you can follow very simple basic house rules. If not, you can spend the summer at dad’s, I’m done with the bs
	3:51 PM	Jason:	seems fair. thanks for keeping me in the loop. i might let him mow tomorrow so i can stay off my foot a few more days
	3:51 PM	Jessica:	Good idea
	3:52 PM	Jason:	something on the carpet to the upstairs smells strongly of urine. noticed it after i locked the upstairs door and wondered if he was made and actually peed there. much stronger smell than litterbox.
	3:52 PM	Jason:	*mad
	3:53 PM	Jessica:	Sadly..... That wouldn’t shock me
	3:53 PM	Jason:	thought the same
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	God I hope him enlisting works
	3:55 PM	Jason:	I hope so too
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	I think he definitely has to go to Wallowa to if you don’t mind dealing with him. I don’t think either of us is comfortable with him being here unattended
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	If you think he will just make things difficult I can arrange Amanda or Joe to be in charge of him
	3:57 PM	Jason:	No worries. He’s usually good when not around a group of buddies. I was planning for him at Wallowa.
	3:58 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	Planned on leaving the Jeep there while I’m gone, figured you guys might prefer to take it or for adventuring. I can use the car the few days before you guys are back.
	4:00 PM	Jason:	Sounds good. Figured I’d take the car to Wallowa since it’s just three of us and not hot that way.
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	Mmmmm, yeah it is. I remember how miserable the girls were when they took it... You can decide when it’s go time
	4:02 PM	Jason:	Oh, okay
	5:10 PM	Jason:	Brenna would like to call
	5:33 PM	Jessica:	one sec, on with Ingrid
	5:42 PM	Jessica:	she messaged...wants her hair a bit shorter
	5:42 PM	Jason:	Yep
	5:42 PM	Jason:	She still wants to call
	5:43 PM	Jessica:	ok
	5:51 PM	Jessica:	did Hunter get his room done?
	5:52 PM	Jason:	Yep. And I reminded him about mowing.
	5:54 PM	Jessica:	Good, I told him as well. He wanted me to come take him to get his ear pierced because he has money. I said if he was helpful maybe you would take him this weekend
	5:54 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:54 PM	Jessica:	Also, tell Brenna saying I love you more and hanging up doesn’t count
	5:54 PM	Jason:	He said nothing about it
	5:55 PM	Jessica:	I told him to call and arrange it first, he may only need to be 16. If not to speak with you
	5:55 PM	Jason:	Brenna still pleased with herself
	5:56 PM	Jessica:	little brat
	6:34 PM	Jessica:	Carrie can do 2:15 tomorrow if you can bring her
	6:34 PM	Jason:	Sure. I’ll put it on my calendar.
	6:34 PM	Jessica:	She’ll be thrilled.. She was worried about waiting

Saturday, June 23, 2018

	10:39 AM	Jason:	good luck. make sure coffee is stocked.
	10:40 AM	Jason:	i think brenna decided 10pm is too late to see a movie
	10:40 AM	Jason:	she insisted on going at that time
	10:40 AM	Jessica:	it is, have had 3 already..better lay off it
	10:40 AM	Jessica:	yeah, you guys are nuts, was it good?
	10:40 AM	Jason:	yeah, like the others, dumb but fun
	10:40 AM	Jessica:	figured
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	did Hunter stay there or at Haydens? He touched base with me at 10:30 and he wasn’t sure, Saw he called me around midnight but I was asleep
	10:42 AM	Jason:	he was here when we got home at 12:30
	10:42 AM	Jason:	haven’t checked this morning
	10:42 AM	Jason:	didn’t seem to be anyone else here

	6:54 PM	Jessica:	She sounded like it. Glad it was a good first time, over her jitters
	7:06 PM	Jason:	I don’t imagine Hunter checked in with you about going anywhere? He agreed to mow before going anywhere.
	7:09 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	7:10 PM	Jason:	okay
	7:10 PM	Jessica:	He’s called multiple times about phone, also reminded him about the mowing, told me he was about to do it earlier. Call him
	7:12 PM	Jason:	i vote no phone assistance until he can do the one small thing he agreed to
	7:13 PM	Jessica:	I agree.
	7:14 PM	Jessica:	Can’t follow rules, no phone help
	8:29 PM	Jessica:	Respond?
	8:30 PM	Jason:	he said he’s helping summer move his mom’s house and will mow first thing tomorrow
	8:30 PM	Jason:	i don’t even bother to check bs but will make sure he mows
	8:31 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	8:34 PM	Jessica:	Back to study mode, just stayed a short while. Nice to let my brain have a break though
	8:35 PM	Jason:	yeah, good to have breaks. glad you got one. brenna asking when we’re going to ride again. watching scary movie now. plow through that stuff.
	8:37 PM	Jessica:	Dan a bit tipsy since they all prefunked at first stop. It was Melissa’s 40th Friday, Dan’s 44 today
	8:37 PM	Jessica:	You have her hooked, mission accomplished
	8:38 PM	Jason:	Sounds amusing :)
	8:48 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, they are going to start barhopping...I made a run for it

Sunday, June 24, 2018

	10:31 AM	Jason:	*on
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	I talked to him last night
	10:31 AM	Jason:	(i fell back asleep listening to npr)

	10:36 AM	Jason:	that’s the plan after I confirm we have a working raft
	10:36 AM	Jason:	figured i’d drive to the endpoint and uber to barber
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	Jealous, going to be hot today. Had two other girlfriends ask me to go today. Stupid studying
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	I can take a break and pick you guys up
	10:37 AM	Jason:	we’ll send pictures 😝
	10:38 AM	Jason:	okay, will let you know closer to the time and see if that still works for you. no big deal to uber.
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	sounds good
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	I’ll message Hunter now and remind him to get going
	10:57 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:58 AM	Jason:	last raft user was an abuser. caked in sand and dead plants and two holes. i’ll have to see if walgreens has patches or something.
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	Maybe easier to buy a new one at Albertsons, they usually have them out by now
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	I almost there this away thinking it was some funny advertising thing, but the hand wax seal had me curious. Coolest bridal shower invite I’ve ever seen 😂

	5:04 PM	Jason:	Also hit big rock and tore off piece of metal
	5:04 PM	Jason:	Not sure this ended up being helpful 🤣
	5:07 PM	Jessica:	so true

	9:25 AM	Jason:	sweet thanks
	9:25 AM	Jason:	oh, btw, have meeting tomorrow that would keep me from taking. any other drives are fine.
	9:26 AM	Jessica:	ok
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	foot getting better?
	9:33 AM	Jason:	mmm, actually not any better. must have wallked onit too much over weekend. a few days sitting here at work should do the trick.
	9:33 AM	Jason:	take your test yet?
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	well dang it, told you not to over do it
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	1:30
	10:16 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	oh you must be in heaven
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	looks low already, better hide it
	10:20 AM	Jason:	it’s so good. dangerous.
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	looks like a costco purchase, should be easy to find
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	though you would probably eat the whole thing in a day, so maybe avoid that😬😂
	10:21 AM	Jason:	was just saying that to someone here. “can’t buy this for home”
	10:24 AM	Jessica:	the kids would beat you to it most likely
	10:28 AM	Jason:	we’d be fighting over it. there’d be blood.
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	Most likely
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	Huge what I think is a spider bite on my ass😂
	11:39 AM	Jason:	that doesn’t sound fun. i guess you’ll be searching your room for spiders later.
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	Exactly
	11:40 AM	Jason:	at least you weren’t poisoned, i guess :)
	11:42 AM	Jessica:	True, itches like crazy though which isn’t an attractive thing to remedy😬
	11:52 AM	Jason:	ha ha :)
	1:47 PM	Jason:	hoping your brain is zippy
	2:09 PM	Jason:	update from AJ: “Hunter is talking about going out with friends to go cliff jumping
And that they were gonna come over for a bit”
	2:09 PM	Jason:	she’s good at this
	2:42 PM	Jason:	result?
	2:54 PM	Jason:	i hope you’re popping champagne corks
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Missed it by 2
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Waay harder test than last time
	3:12 PM	Jason:	ah hell. sorry.
	3:13 PM	Jason:	hopefully drinks with friends after work
	3:17 PM	Jason:	or you’re welcome to come chill and watch some westworld or handmade with drinks :)
	3:44 PM	Jessica:	Currently, I don’t want to be around anybody.
	3:44 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:44 PM	Jason:	hang in there
	3:47 PM	Jessica:	I seriously can’t handle another crappy thing happening in my life right now
	3:49 PM	Jason:	beach soon
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	I desperately need it
	3:56 PM	Jason:	You sent a GIF from GIPHY.
	3:56 PM	Jason:	(okay, sorry, that’s a bit frenetic now that i see it)
	4:52 PM	Jessica:	Let’s plan on kids here tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday...really not in the best mood right now
	5:02 PM	Jason:	You’re planning to stay home those days?
	5:04 PM	Jason:	I’ll update with AJ
	5:04 PM	Jason:	She’s available this week if you need her
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	No, I have to go into work. But can do what I normally do which is work later and home at lunch, then Brenna has gymnastics one of those days. So maybe just have AJ tomorrow and Friday? I think I’m picking up from gymnastics tomorrow anyway so will just Bring Brenna here. She can go there after gymnastics Thursday. My flight is at 5am Saturday 😬😖
	5:09 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:09 PM	Jason:	That works. Just wanted to let AJ know when we need her
	5:10 PM	Jessica:	thanks
	5:10 PM	Jason:	Hunter floating river now
	5:11 PM	Jason:	Terrible flight time
	5:12 PM	Jessica:	Exactly, but at least in Boston by 2. Guess I’ll finish his national guard paperwork
	5:27 PM	Jessica:	Keep an eye out for my license, not sure that can be forwarded?
	5:27 PM	Jason:	Will do. I’ll go check mail now
	5:28 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	5:35 PM	Jason:	Nothin’ for ya
	5:35 PM	Jessica:	Figured to early, would be nice if here by Friday
	5:35 PM	Jason:	i’ll be sure to check it each day
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	8:18 PM	Jessica:	Not my evening plan
	8:18 PM	Jason:	what’s that?

	8:23 PM	Jason:	i guess so
	8:23 PM	Jason:	you should be able to leave when his guardians get there, right?
	8:24 PM	Jason:	i probably don’t want to know the dumb details
	8:24 PM	Jason:	better be a serious injury
	8:24 PM	Jason:	(but hoping it isn’t, of course)
	8:28 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, he’s 18, living with Joe and Amber (Hayden’s) waiting for one of them to get here. Busted his knee over a rock/rapid
	8:30 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully not as bad as it looks
	8:58 PM	Jessica:	Wet stinky teen boys and tons of sand... guess Jeep cleaning tomorrow
	8:59 PM	Jason:	Oooh boy, you’re lucky

	9:04 PM	Jessica:	Glass of wine for me
	9:05 PM	Jason:	Knee prognosis?

	9:23 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:23 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.

	10:42 AM	Jason:	how is the spider bite?
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	itchy, not pretty, good thing no one sees my ass
	10:46 AM	Jason:	😆
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	Hunter stay there last night or Hayden’s? I didn’t hear from him but his phone has been an issue with working
	10:49 AM	Jason:	There’s always the “as far as I know caveat” but he arrived home about 10pm so I think he stayed there
	10:49 AM	Jason:	do you know where the raft ended up?
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	I think one of the other kids was supposed to deflate and bring them. I’ll have Hunter track it down.
	10:52 AM	Jason:	Okay, not terribly worried about it since Hunter said he was fixing the leak but got home and saw he’d tried using duct tape so I imagine it’s in bad shape now. :)
	10:52 AM	Jason:	Just wondered if it was filling up the back of the Jeep or something ...
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	I don’t think so...just sand and dirt everywhere.
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	I wish it was chili day
	11:16 AM	Jason:	that does sound kind of good
	11:18 AM	Jessica:	right?
	11:32 AM	Jason:	what’s the ride plan for brenna today? you’re picking up afterwards?
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	confirming now
	11:36 AM	Jason:	it’s the one day i have a meeting in the way, thats why i wondered
	11:37 AM	Jessica:	I’ll be able to cover if needed. I remembered you said you had a meeting.
	11:53 AM	Jessica:	Is there an attorney you are using for the next set of paperwork?
	11:54 AM	Jason:	yeah. he’ll file the response, i guess.
	11:56 AM	Jessica:	Okay, Angela had asked as far as next steps, wasn’t sure if or who you were using for them to correspond with.
	11:57 AM	Jason:	I think he was going to file a response this week.
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	I still want chili
	12:02 PM	Jason:	i bet you can find some
	12:03 PM	Jessica:	getting harder, all the restaurants stop serving soup in the summer damn them, guess it’s a salad instead
	12:04 PM	Jason:	it was big beets (there you go) and sprouts for me
	12:04 PM	Jessica:	😬😂
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez, poor Heather and Eric. they have to re-pipe whole house, walls being torn out that are damaged  10K out of pocket
	1:06 PM	Jason:	holy crap, what happened?
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	Pipe burst upstairs somewhere. flooded everything down through
	1:10 PM	Jason:	that’s terrible
	1:11 PM	Jason:	brenna messaging about skipping today. not sure about status of the one-a-month deal. she’ll be missing two next month.
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	I would say I’m fine with it, but she’ll need to do at least one Saturday make up next month
	1:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:37 PM	Jessica:	Lee just decided to be on her own for summer schedule..which I think is good, gets to hard when things change..and she doesn’t usually take much anyway
	1:37 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	Brenna’s been busy
	3:23 PM	Jason:	She sharing pictures?
	3:23 PM	Jessica:	yep
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	You’ll see when you get home
	3:37 PM	Jessica:	I’ll get the kids after rotary
	3:38 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:52 PM	Jessica:	Maybe Thursday we do a family dinner before I’m gone then you guys are at Wallowa when I get back?
	5:23 PM	Jason:	Yeah, sounds good
	5:24 PM	Jason:	we just ate at zeppole. meant to do wasabe but not open yet.
	5:25 PM	Jessica:	We can just bbq or something easy. Just thinking with so much craziness, I want the kids to know and feel like it’s still our family regardless.
	5:25 PM	Jessica:	Wasabi does sound good
	5:25 PM	Jason:	Agreed
	5:26 PM	Jessica:	Rotary time😂
	5:26 PM	Jason:	have fun
	5:27 PM	Jessica:	I heard that in my head with a bit of sarcasm
	5:27 PM	Jason:	i think you know how to hear me
	7:14 PM	Jessica:	I know things are a bit crazy right now, but please give me a heads up on things. Brenna’s first questions and comments the second I got in the Jeep were about someone coming to the house to say what it’s worth and because you have to split things with me. Obviously I know there was more of a conversation, but it would help to know what it was so we’re on the same page. It brought up questions for her and it would have been nice to be a little prepared
	7:16 PM	Jason:	Sure. It was a short exchange. Just explained moms and dads share equally and need to kno
	7:16 PM	Jason:	... know the right amount to share
	7:18 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	In the interest of keeping each other in the loop of conversations, I enforced what you said, that as we have had years of a marriage and home together, as that part seperates we are trying to figure out how to fairly split things so that I am also able to build a home for us in the future as you want to do the same there with the house. Our goal is to be supportive of both of us doing that for them. She seemed to be very concerned about me keeping my name and wondering what my maiden name is😂Also suggesting for us to just share the same house to make it easier.
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	Kid concerns and logic 😁
	7:40 PM	Jason:	Then she couldn’t have as many bedrooms, remind her
	7:41 PM	Jessica:	ha, good point
	7:43 PM	Jessica:	I told her I was keeping my married name, Hunter jumped in to enforce that was how you do it when you have kids (yeah, he had an opinion about it..funny) she was happy with that.
	7:44 PM	Jessica:	Interesting the things they find important at that age
	7:45 PM	Jason:	Like to feel secure
	7:46 PM	Jessica:	That was the goal
	7:59 PM	Jessica:	$#@!
	7:59 PM	Jessica:	Stuck watching spy kids
	7:59 PM	Jason:	Sorry
	8:00 PM	Jason:	You can come here now that you’ve got them thherr
	8:00 PM	Jessica:	😂
	8:01 PM	Jessica:	What’s funny..is I remember Kayla and Hunter snuggled watching the first one, now it’s Hunter and Brenna
	8:01 PM	Jessica:	And they’re being nice to each other 🤯
	8:02 PM	Jason:	Amazing what tv can do
	8:13 PM	Jessica:	OMG...I forgot how stupid these movies are
	8:14 PM	Jason:	You’re watching?
	8:15 PM	Jessica:	Quality time with the kids 🤔🤨😂
	9:20 PM	Jessica:	Proof
	9:20 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:20 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:20 PM	Jason:	:) i guess it’s true
	9:22 PM	Jessica:	I thought she would ditch once Xbox on... she’s advising
	9:40 PM	Jessica:	I’m going to send you an article link, the only reason is because when I read it I thought... exactly...over and over again. I know we’re not having any discussions around why we are where we are, about how we feel about any of it. I realize how I feel doesn’t mean much to you, but in the lack of words, I felt like this explains so much of how I’ve felt for so long, things I was trying hard to communicate, fix. I feel like it sums up how things got so broken. Not as any judgement, just as things to consider moving forward on both our parts, work to be aware of. Mistakes hopefully not remade in our futures.
	9:40 PM	Jessica:	This millennial dating coach says these key things keep a marriage alive https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-put-spark-back-your-marriage-according-dating-coach-ncna884386
	9:41 PM	Jason:	Thanks. I read that. I’ll read it again more closely.
	9:41 PM	Jason:	And of course how you feel is meaningful ...

Wednesday, June 27, 2018

	12:12 AM	Jessica:	Since I seem to be letting you know how I feel today... I’m angry and heartbroken right now. Brenna got very upset tonight with the realization of everything after today’s events with the appraiser being there and discussion. I know these are hurdles that are going to come..but no planning or conversation was a jerk think to do. She was in tears tonight. It took a late night bubble bath war to get her happy again. I know in your mind you take action based on your logic, please stop before you do so. You impact others without understanding.
	8:33 AM	Jason:	It is possible you’re jumping to a conclusion. I sit next to Brenna multiple times each week and ask how she’s feeling and if there’s anything she wants to tell me. I know this is hard for her even if it doesn’t rise to her full awareness (at her age). The appraiser was here only a few minutes. I intentionally explained his purpose in casual terms with positive concepts like sharing. We then spent the rest of our time here together, playing and making weekend plans. She gave no sign of being upset. In my experience, however, divorce between the biological parents who raised them will give a child heartache and regret for many years. It’s simply the cost of this direction, not a sign they’ve been impacted by something new.
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	I’m not sure how her being upset is me jumping to conclusion? I’m just asking for better communication from you, to be aware that even though she might say nothing to you, she does feel it. Saying, hey Jess I have an appraiser coming over today while Brenna’s here, simple thing.
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Now to take dog for surgery
	10:40 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:40 AM	Jason:	Uh oh, what surgery
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	Brooke has these huge fatty tumors that needed removed. Dana got stuck sleeping in the Denver airport last night so just now flew in. Brooke was scheduled at 9 so had to take her.
	11:00 AM	Jason:	that sound fun 😒
	11:43 AM	Jessica:	when the password rest email hits the banking@trailimage can you forward it since I’m obviously no longer on any of the banking or billing emails.
	11:47 AM	Jason:	Sure. When I updated bills to pull from my account, I also updated the e-mail address since I will most likely own those bills going forward.  “banking” still exists, just not much used.
	8:00 PM	Jessica:	Can you take Piper & Brenna tomorrow?
	8:00 PM	Jason:	Sure
	8:00 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:00 PM	Jason:	jealous
	8:04 PM	Jessica:	Tin roof does have good little tacos
	8:04 PM	Jason:	i didn’t know
	8:05 PM	Jason:	i’m just looking at the ice cream though
	8:06 PM	Jessica:	It’s half bobas
	8:06 PM	Jason:	gross
	8:06 PM	Jessica:	Exactly, she likes Aspen leafs better than blue cows..juicier
	8:09 PM	Jessica:	Still nasty
	8:09 PM	Jason:	yeah, there’s nothing that can make that texture right

Thursday, June 28, 2018

	10:23 AM	Jason:	assuming brenna will be at your place, ready around 1:45?
	10:24 AM	Jessica:	yep
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	Dana is there so I’ll message her a reminder. Brenna wants to play life tonight after dinner. We bought it last night and played. If it’s going to be late with dinner/games it will probably make more sense for her to stay the night there after since AJ watching her tomorrow. Rather than run her to my house late to sleep then back over in the morning.
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	Also, don’t let me forget a suitcase!
	10:33 AM	Jason:	Sounds like a plan!
	10:33 AM	Jason:	Suitcase, suitcase
	12:01 PM	Jason:	the trouble with beets and quinoa in salad is everytime a bit of lettuce bounces around while eating, it launches little neon red grains onto my computer
	12:09 PM	Jessica:	First world problems 😉
	2:58 PM	Jessica:	Brenna figure out her hair dilemma?
	2:59 PM	Jason:	I guess so. I didn’t hear of it.
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	She was stressing because it doesn’t go into a normal ponytail anymore. She didn’t like any of my suggestions...shocking
	4:26 PM	Jessica:	I’ll be by about 6:30?
	4:27 PM	Jason:	Sounds good
	5:58 PM	Jason:	Did you have any dinner plans? I can grill or maybe order some Chinese?
	6:10 PM	Jason:	ordered chinese :)(
	6:10 PM	Jason:	:)
	6:11 PM	Jessica:	No plans, winging it.. crazy today. Grabbing Hunter and on the way

Friday, June 29, 2018

	10:59 AM	Jessica:	my brain is already in vacation mode
	10:59 AM	Jason:	I bet that feels good.
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	yes and no. I need to get a ton of stuff done and my brain has already checked out...AND Will had a masseuse come in to give massages today so I’m really going to be worthless soon 😂
	11:08 AM	Jason:	well, you’re bringing your laptop. you’ll have something to do in the airport.
	11:09 AM	Jason:	sounds like i’m going on a dirt trail bike ride with jeff here in a minute

	8:54 PM	Jason:	Where’s first connection?
	8:54 PM	Jessica:	Denver, only hour layover fly to Boston at 7:20
	8:56 PM	Jason:	Bring your sleep mask
	8:56 PM	Jessica:	I just realized I think Brenna has it. I’ll pick one up at airport
	8:57 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:58 PM	Jason:	We’ll need to go over for scratchy and her phone if nothing else
	9:02 PM	Jessica:	Oh no, didn’t realize she didn’t pack them.

Thursday, July 5, 2018

	4:32 AM	Jessica:	Her address
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	do you have her address?
	10:17 AM	Jason:	I’m waiting to hear back. I can come up with the last Japan address she gave. I doubt it really matters.
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, probably not
	10:18 AM	Jason:	52-753 Takamitsu, Orido-cho
Nisshin-shi, Aichi 470-0115
	10:19 AM	Jessica:	I’ll just go with that. Need to get this turned in
	10:22 AM	Jessica:	Brenna enjoy her 4th?
	10:23 AM	Jason:	Yep. We bought fireworks, of course, then lit off with Christine and folks. She wanted that instead of downtown fireworks. Brenna and AJ pretty much took turns carrying things out, lighting them.
	10:23 AM	Jason:	She was nervous about it, as usual, until she did a few.
	10:23 AM	Jason:	Afterwards we motorcycled down along the park and saw the end of the downtown show. We didn’t stop, just rode by.
	10:23 AM	Jason:	She thought that was cool.
	10:24 AM	Jessica:	Probably a better idea than the crowds
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	Hunter is not wanting to go to Wallowa, is asking to stay with a friend tomorrow until I’m home Saturday
	1:19 PM	Jason:	did he say why? i guess it’s his choice at this point. obviously the house would be totally locked. i’d have to give AJ my own key to feed animals.
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	There’s nobody really for him to hang out with his age, I think he’s having fun with his friends. I didn’t give him an answer, told him we would need to talk about it first and if agreed I need to talk to parent of where he’s staying. I can drop my key for AJ if needed
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	Also.. Brenna just got up
	1:28 PM	Jason:	kaden is nearly his age. i suppose wanting to stay with his friends here is the main reason.
	1:28 PM	Jason:	people keep talking to me here
	1:28 PM	Jason:	she told me she just got up when we chatted an hour ago
	1:28 PM	Jason:	maybe just laying bed
	1:28 PM	Jason:	lazy butt
	1:31 PM	Jessica:	Kaden not quite same age as a senior boy. Yeah, she called a bit ago and had me stay on while she packed for Wallowa and made some lunch. She couldn’t find the blue suitcase, told her to get it all layed out till your home.
	1:33 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:34 PM	Jessica:	Do you want me to drop key to AJ?
	1:35 PM	Jason:	yeah, that would be be helpful
	1:35 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	Are you taking the Jeep?
	1:39 PM	Jason:	nah, probably just car, especially if it’s just brenna and i
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	Okay, hopefully not too hot
	1:42 PM	Jason:	at this rate, she’ll just sleep the whole way
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	Good point
	4:09 PM	Jessica:	Gymnastics skip?
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Yeah. I told her she’d be in for a couple weekends.
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	Okay, I’ll try and schedule a couple

Monday, July 9, 2018

	2:07 PM	Jessica:	Not there, maybe mailed to  the office? Is there interoffice mail?
	4:35 PM	Jason:	Bummer I don’t really have an office. I’ve never known there to be interoffice mail. Sent message to payroll lady.
	4:35 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	4:35 PM	Jason:	Thanks for checking. Everything good with Hunter and work?
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Probably best to keep our conversations strictly to pertinent kid/money things since you’ve decided not to try and salvage our friendship or be amicable
	4:40 PM	Jason:	Not sure what you mean but will respect your wishes
	4:49 PM	Jessica:	I got the response today. Some I get because it’s template lawyer stuff that goes back and forth. Choosing to make our divorce because of me was messed up as you know damn well that wasn’t it.       I wasn’t even asking you to take responsibility for anything, just that we agree out marriage wasn’t salvageable after YEARS of damage. I guess some part of me was still hoping you wouldn’t be petty, that we both want to walk away from 15 years together in a good place and able to move forward and take care of Brenna financially and emotionally. Sad you went and threw that option out the door. Heartbroken that you did the one thing I was hoping wouldn’t happen, regret ever being married to you.
	6:33 PM	Jason:	“Leave the strategy to me,” the attorney told me. When I saw a couple things in your filing that didn’t seem like they’d come from you, I figured you’d received similar advice.

Disagreement about the significance of infidelity doesn’t have to mean Brenna will be uncared for in some way. I am deeply sad about this direction. I greatly miss the version of you I knew. But Brenna can still feel love. She can still hear kind words between us.

I imagine you’re like me right now. I shake off the sense of discouragement by focusing on the kids — listen to the laughter; hear the stories; enforce boundaries with a smile. If your PD books taught me anything, it’s that we can and must choose how we feel in every moment.
	9:40 PM	Jessica:	I’m so tired of hearing that “the version of you” I did the version you wanted for years and it left me alone, hurt, and humiliated while you met your needs in the way that made you happy..even if I was alone crying, no matter how much I tried to communicate, to grab any scrap you may throw at me that would make me hold on a bit longer ( I feel like 12 years is pretty good holding on). The version of me now as a 42 adult woman who has raised kids and failed at this marriage obviously, is years in the making, she grew, she changed by her experiences, you just continue to see me as a preteen that hangs on your every word, rather than grow with me. The difference is..I didn’t bring it into the divorce. Yes, some things obviously are template lawyer stuff, they are preparing to defend their client and since financially you made it clear you wanted to be punitive my lawyer started in a place to protect me. Yet...not once did I bring blame or anything to attack. I have even multiple times tried to tell you how I feel the last few months/weeks only to be ignored. I never had those conversations with him for ammunition about lack of intimacy on every level, sexual and porn issues. Just simply please make it fair and amicable as possible was my goal and my words. I didn’t share the personal stuff. When discussions were raised regarding custody and how shut off you are with people..I shot them down...not an option EVER. It was exactly why I recommended the attorney mediator for the financial stuff rather than an ugly trial blame game that will bring out the worst of everything in our marriage and destroy any of the good. The constant passive aggressive tendencies that you have are exhausting and painful. That you don’t seem to understand them quite honestly...I’m seriously sick of it being it an excuse for “that’s how he is” that’s the way he thinks. It’s like a constant pass for bad behavior. You want to be my friend, still do things to try and be physically close while at the same time being hurtful, non communicative and combative. The significance of infidelity is an issue, because you aren’t being honest regarding everything around it or your part in it. Our marriage quite simply did not come to divorce because of that, as we have agreed on before in the many months of conversation. If anything, there was a brief time of us actually communicating and digging into some of the real issues that had been avoided and unspoken for so long because of it. I’m not hiding it, not choosing to not take responsibility for it, but you are not taking responsibility for the personal stuff that destroyed us, your many actions leading up to and after, and now you are choosing to play the victim and be petty. I agree, Brenna should still feel the love from us to her, that she is safe and protected. She will never hear us speak badly of each other I have no doubt. Those things will be constant. Unfortunately you have shot everything on a different path for the rest. There will be no more “family time” her seeing any love between us you just took away. You’ve now made it a “your house, my house scenario” in which we can’t be around each other and only communicate in black and white days on days off. Also...I think you missed some very important pieces of my PD books or this isn’t the conversation we would be having.

Tuesday, July 10, 2018

	4:30 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:32 PM	Jason:	We’re home. Did you want to grab Brenna or me to drop her?
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	I can get her
	4:34 PM	Jason:	Should she be ready now or in a bit?
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	On my way
	6:22 PM	Jason:	Found check. It was actually here before Friday. Brenna cleaned house and put stack of mail where you used to put it.
	6:27 PM	Jason:	Can’t deposit electronically. Too large.
	6:30 PM	Jessica:	Oh no.....
	6:32 PM	Jason:	Think I can deposit at ATM?
	6:34 PM	Jessica:	Yes
	6:34 PM	Jason:	I didn’t realize you’ve been pulling money out of my account
	6:34 PM	Jason:	That’s why I overdrafted
	6:39 PM	Jessica:	I pulled minimal out, wasn’t sure you wanted me to pull from line. Also, the 850 check was why you overdrafted. My couple hundred wouldn’t have changed that
	6:59 PM	Jason:	True. ATM deposit worked. Thanks.
	7:20 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:21 PM	Jessica:	Do need Laura and Kayla’s phone# for Hunter’s app, they are asking for it. I messaged Kayla, please message Laura
	7:27 PM	Jason:	Will do.]
	8:15 PM	Jason:	Laura’s number 080-8838-0553
	8:17 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Wednesday, July 11, 2018

	12:29 PM	Jason:	Do you have cash for the class? Just noticed the $50/person. No prob if not, I can hit ATM. Can get for you too at ATM if needed.
	12:30 PM	Jessica:	Nope hadn’t grabbed yet
	12:30 PM	Jason:	Okay, I’ll grab $100 for us both
	12:30 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Thursday, July 12, 2018

	11:28 AM	Jason:	Let me know if you see any mistakes here. If your check goes to your account and mine to mine, and we keep paying bills as usual, then our incomes are equal if I transfer about $188 to you each pay period. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pAPflQfwb2bsziswIR1lw5VKhmCj5XO4UqbkRufDd0g/edit#gid=0
	12:38 PM	Jessica:	Looks fine, I planned on paying gymnastics from deposit tomorrow as that didn’t get paid
	12:38 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:38 PM	Jason:	thanks
	12:56 PM	Jessica:	also, keep an eye on the verizon, you should get a credit back on your account because of when I transferred and opened mine
	12:57 PM	Jason:	okay, cool. maybe it will offset the overage from when I hot spotted for brenna.
	12:57 PM	Jessica:	good point
	10:28 PM	Jason:	I’d like to close the billing account as soon as you think it’s okay. Tired of overdrafts. I’d rather anything I forgot just failed and they contact me to fix rather than paying hundreds in overdrafts.
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Go ahead. I sent in the new info for Kayla’s college but can just pay directly until fixed... It’s a whole paper form that had to be faxed.
	10:32 PM	Jason:	Of course. Water bill was the same. Sent paper form, etc. The one I overlooked.
	10:40 PM	Jessica:	Will have to use $ from deposit tomorrow also for Brenna’s leo/warm ups
	10:41 PM	Jason:	And I may have to move money from credit line to cover bills against my acct until next friday. I’ll pay you back for anything you cover that’s not your normal bills.
	10:41 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:42 PM	Jessica:	We’ll figure it out. Time to round up girls to bed and make sure boys turned off grill
	10:43 PM	Jason:	I messaged brenna earlier but she must not be on phone. Tell her goodnight for me.
	10:45 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, there was team snow cones after gymnastics and Piper here. I’ll tell her to check her phone
	10:45 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:47 PM	Jessica:	Her phones dead. She said to say “Good night, love you Dad” with kissy face
	10:48 PM	Jason:	I guess you can relay the same back 😘
	10:57 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Friday, July 13, 2018

	11:29 AM	Jessica:	leo/warm ups $325, gymnastics $262. Top flight that hadn’t gone through 325..that was painful. Expensive kid
	1:22 PM	Jason:	ouch. I’ll get you as much as i can. need anything from equity line?
	1:22 PM	Jason:	(just biked foothills again with guys -- very hot and hard)
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	no I think I’m okay for now, Hunter’s support went in early so that helped. Have a few hundred still after paying for the Tater Dash mud run we’re all doing tomorrow. Brenna’s been asking to do one now that she’s big enough and Hunter loves it. Doing earlier one though, not afternoon heat like biking...ugh sounds horrible
	1:40 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Monday, July 16, 2018

	8:50 AM	Jason:	Probably

	4:04 PM	Jessica:	Friday? Also we should probably look at the calendar and figure out some dates with my trip and Kayla coming for August, not sure when brother ride is. This trip will be harder since I won’t be as available to talk with her as easily:(  I know Kayla wanting to have her during the day as much as possible so probably won’t need AJ as much even if she has evenings with you.
	4:05 PM	Jason:	Sounds good (except for the not being able to talk as much)
	4:05 PM	Jason:	I’ll continue living on crumbs and water then :)
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	yeah, still not super excited about the trip yet..even though FINALLY visa got sent.

	4:08 PM	Jessica:	yeah...epi pens going with for sure.
	4:08 PM	Jessica:	any chance my license has showed up?
	4:09 PM	Jason:	i’ll go grab the mail right now. just got in the house. lyft’ed from from cycle shop where i left mc to get it’s first service
	4:09 PM	Jessica:	that must have been a hot ride
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	going through security with temporary license...not fun
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	Also: Brenna has make up next Wednesday morning at 9. Delaney’s mom trying to plan a sleepover for them there this weekend or weekend of the fourth. Girls came here for afternoon and made slime then swam at their place...now want a sleepover
	4:13 PM	Jason:	105
	4:13 PM	Jessica:	gear should come with misters
	4:13 PM	Jason:	nothing for you in the mail
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	dang it
	4:14 PM	Jason:	mist would have been nice
	4:14 PM	Jason:	was brenna here a bit?
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	after mud run we ran by to get more shoes
	4:14 PM	Jason:	she found the pig’s water holder thingy which is nice

	4:15 PM	Jason:	figured aj had dropped it somewhere
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	yeah, it didn’t have water
	4:15 PM	Jason:	oh, i filled it all the way. that’s not good.
	4:15 PM	Jessica:	that was saturday so all good
	4:16 PM	Jason:	were there mud run pictures? i can’t see your pictures anymore.
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Brenna said " I wish we could do this everyday” when doing all the mud pits...there were 70 stations/obstacles. Didn’t realize so long. Took 2 hours
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	I haven’t posted any yet, they haven’t uploaded them.
	4:17 PM	Jason:	she’s welcome to clean the pond anytime
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	last thing I posted was her painting
	4:18 PM	Jason:	that looked fun. i clicked from there to your instagram and it said there was nothing i could see.
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	that’s weird, your on my fb
	4:19 PM	Jessica:	I always share to both
	4:20 PM	Jessica:	do you even use instagram?
	4:20 PM	Jason:	yeah, sometimes i get notices when you add photos to instragram even if you haven’t put them on fb (and for joel’s audiorax too). i sometimes click to see.
	4:20 PM	Jason:	maybe they’re just phone app notices. can’t remember. so complicated.
	4:21 PM	Jessica:	I’ll look, I can see your profile as a follower
	4:21 PM	Jessica:	and following

	4:27 PM	Jessica:	Need to plan a trip for Brenna to go to Grandma’s
	4:27 PM	Jason:	i’ve told her we would
	4:27 PM	Jessica:	I just couldn’t go that long without seeing her
	4:28 PM	Jason:	understood. it was unfair to spring that on you but my mom made the offer, just thinking it would be fun to have all the grandkids there.
	4:29 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, just bad timing
	4:29 PM	Jessica:	Plus already 3 makeups needed
	4:30 PM	Jason:	right
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	Looked like she had fun at Wallowa
	4:31 PM	Jason:	oh yeah. she loved the swimming and go-karting. her and parker bonded as usual.

	4:31 PM	Jason:	he’s gotten more mellow, thankfully
	4:32 PM	Jessica:	she’s still mad at me for not going, was in tears as soon as she got her about it.
	4:32 PM	Jessica:	oh thank god, was wondering when he would settle down a bit
	4:32 PM	Jason:	the boys were bored most of the time at troy days. maybe don’t tell her they all went to jump time thing.
	4:33 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:33 PM	Jason:	kaden
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:34 PM	Jason:	had to give cat some love like that
	4:34 PM	Jessica:	oh lordy, he got air. Yeah not saying a word.  Not as though she hasn’t been busy since back though
	4:35 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, Brooke does NOT like it if she’s upset
	4:35 PM	Jessica:	I thought she was going to try and sneak the cat out, she’s been arguing for it to go back and forth with her
	4:36 PM	Jason:	that wouldn’t bother me ;)
	4:36 PM	Jessica:	nice try..be happy I’ve put my foot down on them trying to sneak the other one in over there
	4:36 PM	Jessica:	it’s been brought up numerous times
	4:37 PM	Jason:	:)
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Chatting with Alexis
	4:39 PM	Jason:	oh, how’s his school going?
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	I’ve been egging him on the last two weeks over the world cup..“Oh, I hope those Belgians win” etc
	4:40 PM	Jason:	you’re mean like that
	4:40 PM	Jason:	but france won, right?
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	yep
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:41 PM	Jason:	the whole country and god himself celebrating
	4:41 PM	Jessica:	He sent me that, three day madness he said
	4:41 PM	Jessica:	He’s interning in Paris for three weeks
	4:41 PM	Jason:	no doubt good to have different experiences
	4:42 PM	Jessica:	Kayla and them were in Croatia when they were playing them..she said EVERYBODY wearing flags
	4:42 PM	Jason:	probably get stabbed if you endorse the wrong team
	4:42 PM	Jessica:	probably
	4:43 PM	Jessica:	did you see the pics of the falls/pools they posted in Croatia?
	4:44 PM	Jason:	i don’t think so
	4:44 PM	Jason:	last i have is the flip-off
	4:45 PM	Jessica:	go to Matties FB and instagram, she posts more. They have been sending me lots of pics outside of that and video chatting...more about the good and really bad airbnb’s
	4:45 PM	Jessica:	Kayla said the pics don’t come close, water so blue it looked like blue gatorade
	4:47 PM	Jason:	i see the instagrams
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	And Budapest... party central
	4:47 PM	Jason:	swanky
	4:48 PM	Jessica:	In Italy now.. HORRIBLE airbnb
	4:48 PM	Jason:	kind of ironic
	4:48 PM	Jessica:	That’s what I thought
	4:49 PM	Jessica:	There are ants, the AC is broken, WiFi doesn’t work, and the sink is leaking all over the floor
	4:49 PM	Jessica:	Her words
	4:49 PM	Jason:	that’s disgusting
	4:50 PM	Jason:	does airbnb have a review or rating system?
	4:50 PM	Jessica:	I think they stress more because they are trying to do breakfast, lunch and snacks by shopping and only eat out for dinner
	4:51 PM	Jason:	oh, so they want a place that’s comfortable
	4:51 PM	Jason:	and clean enough to cook
	4:52 PM	Jessica:	At least a working kitchen, they’ve gotten the whole range so far. Amazing to horrible. Not much sympathy though considering 😂
	4:52 PM	Jason:	Good point. I’d tolerate a few things to be there in my 20s.
	4:53 PM	Jessica:	exactly, they are in Germany tomorrow poor babies
	4:54 PM	Jason:	I’ll watch the instagram now
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.

	4:56 PM	Jason:	wow
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:57 PM	Jessica:	some not posted to FB/Instagram
	4:57 PM	Jason:	that’s crazy
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	https://www.google.com/search?q=plitvice+lakes&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=imvn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsgO6m1ZfcAhWKJSwKHTYzATYQ_AUIESgB&biw=320&bih=454&dpr=2
	4:59 PM	Jessica:	that’s what she sent me before they went
	4:59 PM	Jason:	hardly looks real
	4:59 PM	Jessica:	Brenna said " I want to be like Kayla when I grow up and travel, but without the boyfriend”
	4:59 PM	Jason:	perhaps smart
	4:59 PM	Jason:	that’s funny
	5:00 PM	Jason:	seems like nick is usually just there in a support capacity anyway 😁
	5:00 PM	Jessica:	sad part is it’s a national park so they couldn’t go in the water
	5:00 PM	Jessica:	good point
	5:30 PM	Jason:	I thought it would be convenient to transfer my Costco Rx to Alb across the street even if it cost a few bucks more. Guess the price ...
	5:30 PM	Jason:	(same pill count, still generic)
	5:32 PM	Jessica:	makes sense
	5:34 PM	Jason:	you didn’t guess the albertsons price
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	You should also be getting an email from Lauren to be able to change your banking info for NWM policies since I know you want to shut down that account. I gave my card info to wings, you can call in with yours and they can split it. I had her delete the billing account
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	uh oh....
	5:34 PM	Jason:	(cat is molesting me)
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	maybe not a good switch?
	5:34 PM	Jason:	$477
	5:34 PM	Jason:	for 90 pills
	5:35 PM	Jessica:	WHAT?????
	5:35 PM	Jason:	just called to switch it back. costco rx tech didn’t seem amused.
	5:35 PM	Jason:	yep, double check it was for 90 pills, generic. i was incredulous.
	5:35 PM	Jason:	*checked
	5:35 PM	Jessica:	that’s just ridiculous
	5:35 PM	Jason:	like $25 or something at costco
	5:35 PM	Jason:	alb lady said “can’t beat costco”
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	that better be morphine or something amazing for that price
	5:36 PM	Jason:	i see the e-mail from lauren
	5:37 PM	Jason:	and i’ll call wings
	5:37 PM	Jason:	paying overdrafts on overdrafts now with that billing account. annoying.
	5:37 PM	Jessica:	Close it
	5:38 PM	Jessica:	I changed my Amazon but didn’t realize prime was a separate one, fixed it

Tuesday, July 17, 2018

	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Costco prescription ready
	11:58 AM	Jason:	Thanks. Does card still need renewed? Oh, I probably don’t have the card.
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	Probably, so at this point probably just get one under you

	9:44 AM	Jessica:	Brenna wants to see the cat today for a bit. I have something at 4 for a bit so told her I would check with you about dropping her off on my way so she can play with her and pick her up on the way back?
	9:46 AM	Jason:	do you know what ACH Withdrawal WF PL CC  for $476 is?
	9:46 AM	Jason:	that sounds fine
	9:46 AM	Jason:	two more overdrafts today. so annoying.
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	No clue WF CC would make me think Wells Fargo credit card? But I can’t imagine what for unless you set up the window payments to your account and they are billing for two months because the previous didn’t go through ? 283 time two equals that
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	238 I meant
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	equals 476
	9:50 AM	Jason:	oh, i guess that must be it. good math.
	9:50 AM	Jason:	crikey, didn’t notice the other one didn’t go through
	9:50 AM	Jessica:	I thought you were closing the billing?
	9:51 AM	Jason:	yeah, was out of town then here until 8 last night
	9:51 AM	Jason:	first chance i get ...
	9:51 AM	Jason:	next paycheck is basically gone already :(
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	Looks like it, I have no clue on the other accounts since I’m not on any joint spreadsheets anymore and there was little communication on transfers and extra spending. Just trying to pay things I have and catch things that got missed if I can tell it was missed, definitely has left no extra for me either which is stressful since I’m not sure what I will have available for my trip.
	9:56 AM	Jason:	you’re on the budget sheet, the one i shared with you
	9:57 AM	Jason:	i spent far under my allotment
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	I think if you add up wallowa, motorcycle gear/payment, appraisal etc...might be more than you thought.
	10:07 AM	Jason:	yeah, appraisal was extra. but the rest wasn’t too much. we can blame gymnastics too. as usual.
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	I think part of the issue has been transitional, not like there was a buffer for extra expenses/transitioning and you’ve spent about 2300 since the 23rd including the appraisal, not including 166 in od fees so no deduction from personal spending to offset
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	back to class
	10:42 AM	Jason:	almost all the bills now get paid out of my account so expenses there are much higher now
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	That was specifically non bills, just personal
	10:46 AM	Jessica:	that was the point I was making, now that you have it all mixed in one account, I don’t think you realized how much was going out. I don’t really care, they are your expenses/spending, just need to make sure I am also able to pay my bills and plan.
	11:04 AM	Jason:	The appraisal and gymnastics are the extra. I paid $850 extra and you paid $912 extra (since that transitional budget shows I pay gymnastics). My expenses otherwise were several hundred less than our distribution ($1470 out of $1792)
	11:05 AM	Jason:	I’ll pay you back for gymnastics plus the regular distribution per the spreadsheet on friday. If you need more for travel, we can discuss options.
	11:06 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a video.
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:07 PM	Jessica:	Croatia and Italy
In Prague again now
	12:07 PM	Jason:	looks pretty rough
	12:08 PM	Jessica:	yeah, poor babies
	12:09 PM	Jason:	so many cool memories for them :)

Thursday, July 19, 2018

	10:36 AM	Jessica:	Are you available to pick up girls from gymnastics if I can’t figure out? Deborah switched things up and now her mom is taking the girls and needs me to pick up. Already had plans to meet Kathi at 5:15 at tastings. I can cancel though if you are busy.
	10:36 AM	Jason:	Sure, I can pick them up
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	I can leave the jeep and walk over so they aren’t roasting
	10:37 AM	Jason:	May camp with Brenna Saturday night. Can Hunter be with you or should i ask him to arrange to sleep over with buddies?
	10:39 AM	Jessica:	that’s fine. I may or may not go to McCall, I have a ton of studying to review so still in the air, but Dana home tonight through weekend so not a problem.  He’s been really good at checking in and has been home most nights and during every day.
	10:41 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	as a side funny note. Brenna wants more my little ponies...is regretting tossing them
	10:42 AM	Jason:	of course
	10:42 AM	Jason:	the cycle of toy interest
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	yes, the LPS’s needed friends in the hot tub
	10:42 AM	Jason:	😃
	1:34 PM	Jessica:	Do you have some time to chat after work? Maybe meet around 4ish? I have to meet Kathi at 5:15 so before then since you then get Brenna?
	1:34 PM	Jason:	sure
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	preference on where?
	1:36 PM	Jason:	not really. your thought is still to leave the jeep? so i could bike home first and we could go somewhere over there. i’m flexible.
	1:37 PM	Jessica:	yeah, that works

Friday, July 20, 2018

	5:04 PM	Jessica:	Is Hunter allowed internet over there? He’s not wanting to go if he  can’t do anything
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	Nvm, he’ll just be here until Sunday
	6:23 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:24 PM	Jason:	just back from shopping. brenna and i are going to bown street party thing. hunter’s xbox has internet during the day limited to something like 4-6 hours ... haven’t looked in a while.
	6:33 PM	Jason:	Do you know where double sleep bag is? If not could you ask hunter?
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	No clue he says
	7:07 PM	Jason:	Thanks for checking
	9:33 PM	Jason:	There was another sleeping bag that someone (I guess one of Hunter’s friends) left in the driveway that I hung up. That one is gone too. I know Huner borrowed the little grill since I saw him putting it away. Maybe that will jog his memory? Did he take sleeping bags then? I’ve looked everywhere.
	9:49 PM	Jason:	It was that camping trip along Grimes Creek. He also took almost all the wood from our woodpile (without asking). There were gone for like two days. Did he really bring no sleeping bags?

Saturday, July 21, 2018

	12:00 PM	Jason:	Does Hunter know which of his friends might have that camping stuff? I still need to get the raft and oars back too. I don’t mind driving somewhere. That sleeping bag is rather critical for it to be workable.
	12:01 PM	Jessica:	He didn’t call or message last night? I told him to
	12:03 PM	Jason:	NO
	12:03 PM	Jason:	sorry, not yelling :)
	1:29 PM	Jason:	no luck? we should try to head out soon, try to make do
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	No answer

Sunday, July 22, 2018

	3:20 PM	Jason:	We are back
	3:20 PM	Jessica:	How did she do?
	3:21 PM	Jason:	She did great. Seemed to love it. Still had the usual things like some evening mosquitoes. She built some bridges along he lake edge and then a fort before we left. Played with MLP. We hiked above the lake and she did gymanstics moves on boulders in the sunset.
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	Very nice. Was worried about that long a ride for her
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	I have the hand saw and chalk line, will drop it off later
	3:22 PM	Jason:	She didn’t seem bothered by that at all. Was worried about descending from Trinity Lookout after seeing the scramble to get up. I told her down was easier and sang a song as we went. She agreed it was easier.
	3:23 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	3:24 PM	Jason:	She used that Trinity Lookout outhouse
	3:24 PM	Jason:	No word yet on the camping stuff, I’m guessing. Was sort of a hassle without that bag. Hard to fit the bigger bags.
	3:27 PM	Jessica:	I’ll follow up again. He’s currently pressure washing the house
	4:29 PM	Jessica:	Just pulling out of driveway, I’ll call when back at house, Brenna upset, heads up
	4:44 PM	Jason:	Oops, try again, phone was in airplane mode
	4:44 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:54 PM	Jessica:	Hunter went with Hayden for a bit. Told him he needs to check in and not just show up there super late
	7:55 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:53 PM	Jessica:	Hunter on his way over to check in. Does have plans with friends later.
	9:55 PM	Jessica:	We need to discuss that situation tomorrow maybe
	10:32 PM	Jason:	He stopped by. Said he was going out to a lake. Seemed a little lit up.
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	?
	10:34 PM	Jessica:	Not sure what that means
	10:36 PM	Jason:	lit up just means a bit buzzed or something
	10:37 PM	Jason:	don’t have my phone on me, just a sec
	10:38 PM	Jason:	Got phone

Monday, July 23, 2018

	12:19 PM	Jason:	had you laid out consequences or boundaries for hunter? i guess that’s a silly question. i know you have. two guys spent the night in his room. he already knew it wasn’t allowed since he tried to lie about it. not the end of the world but doesn’t engender trust.

Tuesday, July 24, 2018

	10:03 AM	Jason:	Is it the usual gymnastics schedule this week? I see Top Flight on Friday. Deborah said tomorrow is 9-1.
	10:03 AM	Jason:	And Piper isn’t going today.
	10:04 AM	Jessica:	She just called, yes Brenna and Piper have makeup tomorrow 9-1. Deborah is taking and her mom picking up.
	10:05 AM	Jessica:	I can take if you need today on my way out. Going to McCall and back in the morning
	10:16 AM	Jason:	Oh, that would be great.
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	okay will plan on it. May take Hunter with me. Meeting Kim at the cabin and she has two teenage boys there so seeing if he wants to go with
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	Brenna messaging to go to lunch again😂
	10:22 AM	Jason:	oh, that would be nice. of course she is.
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	Hunter not going
	1:37 PM	Jason:	Okay. Must have plans.
	1:38 PM	Jason:	Or he just wants to watch the Ready Player One I got for him.
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	And probably because I just woke him up... Told him to clean his room
	1:42 PM	Jason:	Oh jeez. I saw him take out a bag of garbage yesterday. I guess there’s more left. I didn’t check.
	1:44 PM	Jessica:	Box of cheese it’s, plates another box of crackers, etc
	1:45 PM	Jason:	Oh, that’s where the new box of crackers went. I was asking Brenna.
	1:46 PM	Jessica:	Brenna had pretty much every light in the house on and her window open. Closed and turned them all off
	1:47 PM	Jason:	Thanks. I keep telling her to keep her window closed and not to turn on lights. Not sure what he deal is with that.
	1:55 PM	Jessica:	Oh hell...now ready player one rundown
	1:59 PM	Jason:	:)

Wednesday, July 25, 2018

	6:52 PM	Jason:	brenna found missing sleeping bags in playhouse along with bunch of fast food wrappers
	6:54 PM	Jessica:	Yes, she just called me a few minutes ago. That explains a few things

Thursday, July 26, 2018

	8:34 AM	Jessica:	Do you mind if I get kids tonight since I’ll have to bring back Sunday evening. I can cover gymnastics pick up tonight and bringing to top flight in morning
	8:35 AM	Jason:	That’s fine. Brenna was saying she was told she didn’t have to do gymnastics today. Maybe you know different.
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, email went out for top flight girls that they can choose to have a rest day if they want
	8:37 AM	Jason:	I think that was her plan. Then I’m supposed to pick her up at lunch to spend the afternoon here.
	8:39 AM	Jessica:	Oh fun
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Doing roaring springs tomorrow at 6. I’ll leave it to you to decide if you want to go.
	8:42 AM	Jason:	Brenna is insistent but I haven’t said anything without knowing your final thoughts
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	Sorry, boss came in
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	I think if it helps her then we try and make it work. I prefer outings like that as a family over things at the house.
	9:14 AM	Jason:	i’m happy to do family things. i enjoy it.
	11:01 AM	Jessica:	Transferred 20 from your account for counseling, I’ll transfer back later today after I make my deposit
	11:20 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:20 AM	Jason:	Thanks for the heads up
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	Hunter wants to know if he can have 25 to go to Circus Trix with his friends
	12:33 PM	Jason:	Sure
	1:38 PM	Jason:	Seems like you might want to coordinate with Deborah on Fri/Sat ride. I’m sure you know that but she was texting and I tried to say Brenna will be with you then but not sure it was clear. She said she would pick up Brenna at 8:30.
	1:59 PM	Jessica:	Oh thanks, didn’t know she was doing to flight, it was in the air last I knew
	2:00 PM	Jason:	maybe you can make sense of it
	2:00 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:01 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	I’ll call her...that’s funny...gaming at work
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	arrangements made, Piper staying tomorrow night and going to roaring springs with us
	2:12 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:20 PM	Jessica:	kick her for me please
	2:28 PM	Jason:	for any reason or just a general need?
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	yep, she’s being a turd. Complaining because she wanted to invite Delaney to roaring springs
	2:36 PM	Jason:	okay, i’ll kick you
	2:36 PM	Jason:	kick her
	2:36 PM	Jason:	i was looking at her and typing to you
	2:36 PM	Jason:	confusing
	4:35 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:37 PM	Jessica:	Of course
	5:16 PM	Jessica:	I’ll swing by in about an hour. Maybe she’ll be done pouting by then
	5:16 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Friday, July 27, 2018

	8:38 AM	Jason:	Any chance you could meet at bike shop later to buy bike tube? Forgot wallet. Had to leave bike sitting by fence somewhere
	8:39 AM	Jessica:	Sure
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Waiting for Brenna to leave for top flight then will get ready and head in to office
	8:40 AM	Jason:	Whenever it’s convenient
	8:40 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:40 AM	Jason:	I’m still walking
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Is it locked?
	8:41 AM	Jason:	No
	8:41 AM	Jason:	Hoping people are nice
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Uh oh, okay I’ll hurry
	8:43 AM	Jason:	Bike shop by 10 barrel is good
	8:43 AM	Jason:	I’ll start walking there when you go
	8:43 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	Heading there from house now
	9:08 AM	Jason:	okay, walking in a sec
	9:17 AM	Jason:	Damn, not open for 15 mins
	9:54 AM	Jason:	fixed and parked. thanks again
	10:03 AM	Jessica:	no problem, glad it was before I left
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	Probably be there about 6:30. Want me to get you about 6?
	3:56 PM	Jason:	oh sure
	3:56 PM	Jason:	i’ll be done sweating by then
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	Only to get sweaty again, so damn hot out there
	5:23 PM	Jessica:	Can you grab some beach towels, should be a few there
	5:23 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:39 PM	Jason:	Only found one but can grab regular towels
	5:39 PM	Jessica:	I have 2, just grab one more
	5:47 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	8:09 AM	Jessica:	Tanner being taken to harbor view in Seattle really bad car accident
	8:09 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:10 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:14 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:52 AM	Jason:	Oh jeez, that’s awful
	9:56 AM	Jason:	Makes me think of hunter and his buddies

Sunday, July 29, 2018

	2:08 PM	Jason:	Nibbles is gone. I feel a little sad, actually ... at least until the lady (hopefully) shares a picture or something of how happy Nibbles is with five kids loving her.
	2:08 PM	Jason:	Now I’m going to work on sprinkler stuff for the second day in a row :(
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	Oh you are so screwed when she gets there....ballsy. Stupid sprinklers.
	2:10 PM	Jason:	yeah, but you know ... poor thing was getting almost no attention and just making the house smell like a barn
	2:10 PM	Jason:	hopefully the talks we had a few weeks ago where Brenna basically agreed remain applicable
	2:11 PM	Jessica:	Oh, I totally agree with you. She was a sympathy pet when Minnie disappeared and now there is a new cat. Just saying...good luck.
	2:18 PM	Jessica:	I’m leaving the Jeep at Kim’s in the morning, her parents are taking us to the airport. It’s close to you in the new houses behind Jim’s Alibi. W Yogi Lane if you want to get it.
	2:58 PM	Jason:	Still haven’t noticed Nibbles. Now I’m curious how long it will take ... kind of a sign in itself. I’ll let you know when.
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	Use that in your defense!
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	Still nothing huh?
	4:28 PM	Jason:	Nope
	4:28 PM	Jason:	Probably not unlike their response some day when we’re gone
	4:29 PM	Jessica:	yeah...I’m expecting a little moodiness still
	4:30 PM	Jason:	definitely. once they notice.
	5:32 PM	Jessica:	Response I expected
	5:33 PM	Jason:	Yeah. She only noticed because she saw message on my phone when she grabbed it so we could look something up.
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	She’s pretty upset
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	She just needs to cry a bit
	5:35 PM	Jason:	Right. She doesn’t want my attention at the moment so giving her a minute,
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	The joys of parenting
	6:10 PM	Jason:	nearly recovered, i think
	10:18 PM	Jason:	Brenna trying to reach you

Monday, July 30, 2018

	9:11 AM	Jessica:	Jeep’s parked, stopped by and kissed the monster. Have fun looking for a trampoline 😂
	9:12 AM	Jason:	Of course. :) Happy travels.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	Still having anxiety 😜
	9:16 AM	Jason:	Enjoy the moment. Listen to some funny podcasts. Do you and Kim get to sit together?
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	Yes, and it’s her birthday
	9:19 AM	Jason:	free drinks the whole way 🎉

Tuesday, July 31, 2018

	9:47 AM	Jessica:	Brenna is pretty excited about having messenger
	9:56 AM	Jason:	I figured she would be. Been waiting for the Android version of that Messenger for Kids I once showed you to come out.
	9:57 AM	Jason:	Messaging to people we’ve approved is all it does. “Facebook is boring” she said.
	9:57 AM	Jason:	Looks like you survived cramped seating for untold hours.
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	I remembered you looked into that. Yeah she video chatted
	9:58 AM	Jason:	(sprinkler guy is here)
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	My butt is numb, don’t want to be on a plane for awhile
	9:59 AM	Jason:	I bet. That’s crazy long flying. Hopefully you slept a lot of it.
	9:59 AM	Jessica:	Yep.... Tylenol PM and a glass of wine...out
	9:59 AM	Jessica:	Double decker plane
	10:00 AM	Jason:	fun
	10:01 AM	Jessica:	It’s 7pm here, feels like morning
	10:06 AM	Jason:	I’m sure you’ll be screwed up for a few days.

Wednesday, August 1, 2018

	11:03 AM	Jessica:	https://photos.app.goo.gl/MLqnUCh8CZx7kLQP7
	11:05 AM	Jason:	very cool. so ... european
	11:05 AM	Jason:	food good?
	11:08 AM	Jason:	adjusted to the timezone?
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, it’s been pretty good...some not so much. Lots of fish patte and meats
	11:08 AM	Jason:	Oh, having to watch for allergies?
	11:09 AM	Jessica:	No, I was wide awake at 4am. Just took a nap. It doesn’t get dark until 11 and light at 3-4am
	11:10 AM	Jessica:	So far okay on allergies, have avoided seafood places
	11:10 AM	Jason:	oh god. that’s a short night.
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	Nice to walk around this morning when it was dead
	11:11 AM	Jason:	working from home a second day since hunter is going to roaring springs. was home yesterday for the gymnastics drive and meeting sprinkler guy.
	11:11 AM	Jason:	you walked around at 4? or just later on
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	No😂 around 8
	11:12 AM	Jason:	(watching mlp :( )
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	Scott turned off his phone
	11:12 AM	Jessica:	Funny how she likes that again
	11:12 AM	Jason:	jeez, hunter is so coy about that. not sure why.
	11:13 AM	Jason:	he told me his data just wasn’t working right. or maybe he didn’t actually know scott did that.
	11:13 AM	Jason:	anyway, signed him into wifi on his phone but not laptop
	11:13 AM	Jessica:	Could be since the phone was having issues and he was using both. You can let him know Scott turned it off last Friday
	11:14 AM	Jason:	scott messaged me like monday and asked hunter to call him. i relayed the message and hunter said he was doing it right then. gave scott the feedback.
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Miserable hot here, muggy. Hottest heat wave in years
	11:15 AM	Jason:	anyway, that’s all i know
	11:15 AM	Jason:	oh no
	11:15 AM	Jason:	reason to be up early
	11:15 AM	Jason:	cool down at night?
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Yeah.. I’m not dealing with it right now. I’m sure I’ll end up just having to put him on mine
	11:15 AM	Jason:	actually cooler here the last couple days in spite of prediction for hottest days of the year. i think the smoke haze is making a lot of shade. also kind of breazy.
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, night is better
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	I be would kill for a breeze, we’ve been doing a couple cold showers a day
	11:20 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:20 AM	Jason:	everyone watching mlp
	11:21 AM	Jessica:	You’re going to start remembering the episodes from before
	12:53 PM	Jessica:	What was the artsy place in Nevada you and Laura went to?
	12:53 PM	Jason:	Tuscarora
	12:53 PM	Jason:	the hotel with clay boobs for parapets
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	That’s right

Thursday, August 2, 2018

	8:47 AM	Jessica:	In Helsinki
	8:50 AM	Jason:	Hopefully not as hot
	8:50 AM	Jessica:	Sadly....yes
	8:50 AM	Jason:	And you’re getting into “socialist” countries now where, if some Facebook friends are to be believed, must mean it’s total shit there 😂
	8:51 AM	Jason:	Smoky skies here but not noticeable for breathing. Just nice sunsets and not as hot.
	8:52 AM	Jessica:	I’ll keep you posted. Did get you this... supposedly the best black licorice is here, Kayla instructed me to get her some to and she didn’t even like black licorice
	8:52 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:53 AM	Jason:	that does look promising
	8:53 AM	Jason:	i just got some last night while buying the rest of fred meyer’s little ponies
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	Sucker
	8:53 AM	Jason:	i know. i like seeing her play ponies instead of being on her phone or complaining of being bored.
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Very true
	8:57 AM	Jessica:	Did you get the email I forwarded to you?
	9:03 AM	Jason:	Oh yeah, about pool party. I was told earlier I couldn’t plan anything for the weekend since she had that going on.
	9:04 AM	Jessica:	She can still do the sleepover Friday or Saturday with Delaney if she still wants
	9:06 AM	Jason:	I’ll let her know
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	Sprinklers fixed?
	9:11 AM	Jason:	Monday. I’ve been cutting down shrub and digging holes for prep. Tried to get Ava to help.
	9:12 AM	Jason:	At least he agreed it’s not an easy thing to fix. Right where pipes go under the driveway so have to dig out both sides to pull pipes from under.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	Oh no......
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	For the second time... riding this thing just got the a.c. 😂
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	*for
	11:51 AM	Jason:	funny. like that d.c. trip.
	11:52 AM	Jessica:	Exactly
	11:52 AM	Jessica:	But....
	11:52 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:52 AM	Jessica:	Better view
	11:55 AM	Jason:	i’ll give you that :)
	2:36 PM	Jason:	Do you mind if I reduce Jeep insurance to just liability?
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	Did you pick it up?
	2:41 PM	Jason:	No. Was just thinking about it since I went in there to update billing account.
	2:41 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:47 PM	Jessica:	I would like to maybe look at some other options to trade it in for, killing me in gas and not like top/doors come off more than once a year. Looks cool but not sure how practical at this point
	2:48 PM	Jason:	makes sense
	2:49 PM	Jason:	right now we’re enjoined from significant buy/sell, though
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	I’m aware
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	Wasn’t saying immediately
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	Nvm
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	Please tell me when you submitted numbers to your lawyer you did not include the motorcycle
	2:51 PM	Jason:	okay, understood
	2:54 PM	Jason:	told him we agreed it wasn’t included but he asked to see the numbers anyway. i think they’re still working on the proposal since i haven’t been able to supply the final PERSI number yet. waiting for paper mail from them.

	8:34 AM	Jessica:	Is Brenna around?
	8:44 AM	Jason:	Looks like you caught me while biking. She might still be asleep. She didn’t stir when I kissed her and gave a “later alligator."
	8:46 AM	Jessica:	I see she was on this morning. I’ll try again. Ship pills out in 15, no wifi until hotel in Russia tomorrow
	8:47 AM	Jason:	Ah, she probably woke up when I left then and just didn’t feel like moving. Turd.
	8:47 AM	Jason:	Hopefully Russia is cooler. Say hi to Vladimir.
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	What’s with the lease payments?
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	Funny
	8:52 AM	Jason:	Brenna and I looked at cheap, short-term car leases to consider in the future. Is that what you mean? We also looked at trampolines.
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Just saw over 100 for lease stuff, since we don’t or anything was confused. Silly to pay that for looking, just go in to some dealerships.
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	*owe
	9:01 AM	Jason:	Difference with those sites is they’re private lessees looking to transfer the last 6 or 9 months for cheap, which is all I would want. Prefer to buy something cheap down the road.
	9:04 AM	Jessica:	Makes sense, reminder in your words though: right now we’re enjoined from significant buy/sell, though. Leasing is the same thing
	8:16 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:12 PM	Jessica:	Coming into Port
	11:12 PM	Jason:	No sea sickness?
	11:13 PM	Jason:	Went to live music thing with Diana, Eric, then Brenna spending night
	11:17 PM	Jessica:	Fun
	11:17 PM	Jessica:	Downtown music?
	11:18 PM	Jessica:	Just woke up, could sleep all day. First quiet, cool sleep
	11:19 PM	Jason:	Basically. Up on the bench but downtown kind of thing. Nice cool evening. Great singer. Good fries and beer.
	11:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Saturday, August 4, 2018

	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Let me know when Brenna’s home. They have free international calls at the hostel so I can call
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Super amazing hostel
	10:06 AM	Jason:	Oh fun. I’ll let you know.
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:07 AM	Jessica:	You can color in the bathroom 😂
	10:07 AM	Jason:	That’s a good idea :)
	10:07 AM	Jason:	Looks super nice
	10:08 AM	Jessica:	Making Russian pancakes in an hour 😂
	10:08 AM	Jason:	Curious to hear how Russian pancakes differ. Are they like Russian dressing?
	10:09 AM	Jason:	I’ll be glad when Tanner leaves the hospital so Facebook messenger doesn’t chime so often
	10:10 AM	Jason:	But still want to be in conversation to see he’s improving
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	Funny... I’ll let you know
	10:10 AM	Jessica:	Agreed, non-stop fb is annoying
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Did I tell you they found the other guy at fault with the boat?
	10:11 AM	Jason:	No, that’s surprising from the first account I heard. Seems like that should have been in the shared chat. Why?
	10:12 AM	Jessica:	He was drinking and had his headlights off. Video chatted with Mom and Doug
	10:13 AM	Jason:	Oh god, well duh then
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	That’s the last version anyway...who knows
	10:13 AM	Jason:	... right ...
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	Just went to the top of that cathedral
	10:19 AM	Jason:	... well I just filled my coffee cup and sat on the orange couch 😝
	10:19 AM	Jason:	that must have been cool
	10:20 AM	Jason:	i bet these places all have a real “feel” (for lack of better word)
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, I’ll upload and share the folder when back at the hostel, going to have a ton of pics the next few days
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.

	10:25 AM	Jason:	amazing detail
	10:25 AM	Jason:	looks just like the streets where you see russian spy scenes in movies
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	It’s crazy
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	Size perspective
	10:28 AM	Jason:	you look the same size
	10:29 AM	Jessica:	Very funny
	11:30 AM	Jessica:	https://photos.app.goo.gl/LUT8g3jkVrwQrDVD6
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	Helsinki...not to many. We weren’t super excited about it. Glad it was only one day https://photos.app.goo.gl/KBR3NGqhLdy9SLHz6
	11:38 AM	Jason:	wonderful images
	11:40 AM	Jessica:	There will be a lot more I add the next few days. Not sharing the link on FB until each place complete
	11:40 AM	Jason:	i like the smoking warnings
	11:41 AM	Jessica:	Right?😂
	2:05 PM	Jason:	Hmmm, Brenna just told me Hunter left camping yesterday after a bunch of teens were here. Checked back woodpile and it’s now completely gone. Raft never made it home so he knew he wasn’t supposed to go. What seems like the right consequence? Lock up XBox and stuff again until raft returns? Not sure ...
	2:05 PM	Jason:	Didn’t notice he was gone because he’s usually still asleep until now so hadn’t checked. Oh, Brenna just got home.
	2:08 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, I knew he was planning on camping. Consequences for sure
	2:08 PM	Jessica:	For raft and not asking about wood
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	He didn’t get money this time so that was probably his contribution
	2:10 PM	Jason:	Right, you’d mentioned the camping but I heard you say it was only if the raft made it home so that should have ended the plan.
	2:11 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	2:12 PM	Jason:	Is the military thing still on track? His room is a gross disaster as usual with old food. I’d like some hope. :)
	2:13 PM	Jessica:	Yes, still set
	2:13 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:14 PM	Jessica:	Agreed...hope
	3:09 PM	Jessica:	Calling in a moment, will be a weird number

Sunday, August 5, 2018

	1:53 PM	Jessica:	She around if I call shortly?
	2:18 PM	Jason:	Yep, ready now
	2:18 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:38 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:12 PM	Jason:	That’s quite the phone

Monday, August 6, 2018

	1:34 AM	Jessica:	But it works!
	8:04 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:05 AM	Jason:	Checking if that looks right
	8:05 AM	Jason:	Small late fee
	8:06 AM	Jessica:	Shouldn’t be anything with both insurances. I’ll call Thursday. At least they both finally paid, was 1950
	8:08 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:10 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:10 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:10 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:20 AM	Jessica:	Any discussion with Hunter?
	8:38 AM	Jason:	I let him know he was grounded when he got home. He asked for a few dollars to get Subway. I was still cleaning house so said sure, we could talk more later. He never came back. At least not until late night or morning. So more talk needed.
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:24 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:24 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:24 PM	Jason:	that’s a good one
	12:25 PM	Jessica:	The staff insisted on a shot of vodka after 😂😂
	12:29 PM	Jason:	I wonder how many shots they end up having every day 🙃
	12:29 PM	Jessica:	We made the kid have one with us... safety first. He was maybe 16
	12:30 PM	Jason:	Contributing to the delinquency of a minor 😇
	12:31 PM	Jessica:	Ummm, wait till you see what I got Hunter 😂
	12:37 PM	Jessica:	Not alcohol...
	12:37 PM	Jason:	I figured not :)
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	So maybe not a big deal but a bit worried about the new decor arrangement. Things that I plan on bringing over, so going to be awkward to disrupt since things now being used?
	1:44 PM	Jason:	I think just the futon ... no worries if you want it. Didn’t know you still did so put it in a spot but not a big deal to take it.
	1:46 PM	Jessica:	And stone table, and some pictures, and things of Kayla’s, and gifts from Heather. I did mention that. I want some things of home I had. Things I went out and got or was given
	1:47 PM	Jessica:	Not cool to assume I just walk away with no memories, pictures anything.
	1:49 PM	Jason:	Things randomly arranged right now. Only pictures hung were my own photographs from upstairs office.
	1:50 PM	Jason:	Brenna was desparate to hang deer head thing. I thought you hated it and I’m not fond so if you want it, free to take. :)
	1:52 PM	Jessica:	Like I mentioned on phone, we need to plan some time so I can get some things. Now that you’ve gone and redecorated... you once again put me in a bad position when I come and disrupt it. Yet I deserve to create some familiar space in my home. Not everything foreign for the kids. Just want you to be aware of that.
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	No, I did like it. Was waiting to finish remodel...just nvm
	1:57 PM	Jason:	You’re welcome to the metal deer head. Maybe I misremembered you making negative remarks about it. Like I said, Brenna dug it out and wanted to hang it. No big deal. We moved a couple of the small shelves and hung pictures -- tired of looking at blank walls. Yeah, some of the framed 5x7 pictures of kids and family got moved but not with any purpose in mind. You are free to choose which you’d like. It’s easy to print more.
	5:24 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	5:24 PM	Jason:	Shall I open or hold for Kayla?

Tuesday, August 7, 2018

	7:00 AM	Jessica:	Hold
	10:21 AM	Jessica:	Any discussion with Hunter?
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	?
	12:39 PM	Jessica:	Hunter had registration today, he can go tomorrow
	1:09 PM	Jason:	Release day here. Been hectic. Worked late yesterday then team thing and just back from team lunch. Did clarify a little more with Hunter. Will spend more time with him tomorrow and go to registration with him. Sill trying to get this release completed.
	1:13 PM	Jessica:	I can take him Thursday if tomorrow you can’t. 5:30am flight, about to sleep. Told Brenna I will shoot for stopping by once I get in at 10pm if still up
	1:14 PM	Jason:	Okay, I’ll let you know if something goes wrong with release and I can’t get away tomorrow. I’m sure Brenna will want very much to be up to see you. Have good sleep.
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	Thanks

Wednesday, August 8, 2018

	11:37 AM	Jason:	Hunter got registered yesterday so you’re off the hook
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	Oh good!

	7:01 PM	Jason:	You’ll sleep well tonight
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, didn’t really sleep this time on the 11hour flight
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	Flight delayed😥
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	Not in until 11 now
	7:05 PM	Jessica:	Ugh... really want my bath
	7:06 PM	Jason:	Oh god, that’s late
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	That may be too late to stop by tonight. May have to be morning unless Brenna totally has a meltdown
	7:09 PM	Jessica:	Maybe start preparing her
	7:14 PM	Jason:	Will do
	7:15 PM	Jason:	Was rinsing dishes. Her and AJ do a lot of “cooking” 🙂
	7:16 PM	Jessica:	Oh jeez
	7:16 PM	Jessica:	Looks like you’re on brother ride again this year for first day of school
	7:18 PM	Jason:	Oh darn
	7:18 PM	Jessica:	Now only 20 min delay 😂
	7:19 PM	Jason:	22nd?
	7:20 PM	Jessica:	20th
	7:20 PM	Jason:	So coming tonight again?
	7:20 PM	Jason:	She wants to see a movie so that’s the bribe if you can’t make it
	7:22 PM	Jessica:	Your call, it will be closer to 11 by the time I get there, get bag, car and drive over. I will shoot for it if you think she will be really upset, if can pull off the bribe, that works too
	7:25 PM	Jason:	She wants you to come by instead of movie
	7:25 PM	Jason:	That’s how special you are
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	Or how much she wants gifts
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	Okay, will do
	7:26 PM	Jason:	Kayla stuff locked in other upstairs room, btw
	7:26 PM	Jessica:	Thank you!!!
	7:26 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:26 PM	Jessica:	Hoping they make up some time in flight
	10:00 PM	Jason:	Departed?
	10:30 PM	Jessica:	Just landed

	8:44 AM	Jessica:	I’m also deliriously tired, been up since 4am so that should be fun
	8:44 AM	Jason:	jeez, why?
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	I think my body doesn’t know what day or time it is and then once I was awake I just started stressing and being excited about Kayla coming
	8:47 AM	Jason:	stupid brain
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	yeah, pretty much. I’m sure I’ll hit a wall at some point
	8:48 AM	Jason:	maybe sat night after some drinks
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	very true
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	on hold with DMV trying to track down my license
	8:49 AM	Jason:	holy crap. that’s dumb. yeah, i’ve been checking mail every day. nothing from dmv

	9:18 AM	Jason:	she gets mad now if i’m not willing to “listen to a story” with her at bedtime
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	she usually tries to sleep with me, we made a deal weekends okay, during week I need sleep
	9:18 AM	Jason:	we never do hear the whole story
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny...for somebody that was always saying the talking gave her a headache

	10:55 AM	Jessica:	okay, that’s funny
	10:56 AM	Jason:	key features: lid that won’t come off in a bike bag; size that fits in a bike bag
	11:02 AM	Jessica:	mission accomplished!
	11:06 AM	Jason:	Off to bike hills
	11:13 AM	Jessica:	You’re crazy
	1:03 PM	Jason:	that didn’t feel very good

	2:00 PM	Jason:	inside of an airport either way
	3:05 PM	Jessica:	Welcome home sign craft shopping
	3:05 PM	Jessica:	Hunter at work😁
	3:05 PM	Jason:	hope it lasts longer than last time
	3:05 PM	Jason:	i’m sure brenna could help make a sign
	3:05 PM	Jason:	or maybe that’s what you’re talking about
	3:06 PM	Jessica:	Yep to both
	3:24 PM	Jason:	I told him we could look at getting a bike to commute over there. He needs one. I noticed he took my bike out last night. In typical Hunter style, he took steps to hide the face, like hanging my helmet and bag right where they were, but also left super obvious clues, like a water bottle in the holder, weeds stuck everywhere, and left in high gear. 😀
	3:24 PM	Jason:	I’ll check Craigslist for some options unless you have other ideas for his work commute
	3:24 PM	Jason:	*hide the fact
	3:40 PM	Jessica:	Good idea
	3:44 PM	Jason:	I’ll send him this list to consider https://boise.craigslist.org/search/bik?hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=322&nearbyArea=469&min_price=100&max_price=300
	3:45 PM	Jessica:	Good options

	3:48 PM	Jessica:	109
	3:56 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:56 PM	Jason:	Empty
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	Yeah... because you’re nuts for biking!
	5:33 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	5:33 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	I think she’s as excited as me

	8:40 AM	Jessica:	you okay?
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	early work morning for you
	8:40 AM	Jason:	oh yeah. you can’t turn right there but he’d pulled way over the bike lane like he would, like people do
	8:40 AM	Jason:	i squeezed beside and waited for green light. he saw me and drove right in front of me as i started.
	8:41 AM	Jason:	i guess i mean 8:20
	8:41 AM	Jason:	bike clock is still on standard time
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	what an ass
	8:41 AM	Jason:	i thought so
	8:41 AM	Jason:	we would have collided if i hadn’t turned and stopped
	8:42 AM	Jason:	in the bike lane on a green light, i should be good to go
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	There is no other route you can take to avoid more of downtown roads? Stresses me out

	8:44 AM	Jason:	i like that route, though
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	seems like you have had a lot more run ins though since biking down here, there is just to much traffic, construction and idiots
	8:59 AM	Jason:	talked to lady at their office. she was very apologetic.
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	hopefully they actually do something about it
	1:04 PM	Jessica:	Kayla walking your way

	1:05 PM	Jason:	You are
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	yep. and Hunter work, and rotary...ugh
	2:47 PM	Jessica:	any chance you could pick up the girls from gymnastics? I could grab them from the house after board meeting. I’ve missed the last few board meetings so am trying to attend one...so that I can bow out gracefully. If not I can see if Dana or Deborah can

	2:51 PM	Jessica:	Thank you!!
	2:51 PM	Jason:	No prob

	9:26 PM	Jessica:	I keep hearing about plans you have tomorrow with Brenna but I haven’t heard any discussion?
	10:22 PM	Jason:	No particular plans, just hoping to coordinate with you to see about taking Brenna to movie, dinner or something, whatever schedule might allow.
	10:26 PM	Jessica:	I’ll touch base tomorrow. We had been making plans as it’s the first time since back she has no gymnastics and Kayla is gone this weekend
	10:27 PM	Jason:	That’s understandable. Maybe just see her for ten minutes then. Whatever works.
	10:31 PM	Jessica:	Can get her for lunch or during day? Or a bit after work?
	10:35 PM	Jason:	Whatever works best for you? After work is easier so I can switch to car

Wednesday, August 15, 2018

	8:55 AM	Jessica:	They want to watch the incredibles 2. I was hoping for a downtown one but it’s 3:30 or 9:45 dang it. So probably the 7:15 at Overland theater. So you could get her before then?

	9:32 AM	Jessica:	well dang, was hoping you already had a copy to forward to me.
	9:33 AM	Jason:	i’ll see what i have
	9:33 AM	Jason:	why would we both have to send the same statements?

	9:52 AM	Jason:	I’ll find that
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	it’s always funny when you share stuff because it says Dad shared with you
	9:53 AM	Jason:	yeah, that’s funny. you should fix that. :)
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	I think my contacts are mixed with Brenna’s
	9:54 AM	Jessica:	nah, it’s funny. I’ll keep it😂
	9:58 AM	Jessica:	okay, I’ll upload those, I messaged asking if that would be sufficient to do ytd rather than 6 months of statements on everything. Hoping so.
	9:59 AM	Jason:	i think it was six months anyway since i did it in june-ish
	9:59 AM	Jason:	just missing july
	10:00 AM	Jessica:	seems good enough to me
	10:00 AM	Jessica:	did you get the appraisal back?
	10:09 AM	Jessica:	6 months is the requirement was the response I got back. Ugh, That’s going to be a pain for checking accounts etc
	10:10 AM	Jason:	did you tell him there is six months of statements there? jan-june
	10:10 AM	Jason:	there was no july statement when i made those since it was still july
	10:11 AM	Jason:	it’s what my attorney has
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	I’m going to upload and hope that’s good enough. I guess if they want July they will say something. Is the capital one card now split between two cards?
	10:13 AM	Jason:	yes, there was no statement yet when i made those. should be now. i’ll check.

	2:26 PM	Jessica:	Hunter not sure how he was supposed to get to work today, I told him to use my bike. You’ll have to touch base with him getting home as there aren’t lights on it
	2:29 PM	Jason:	His bike is scheduled to be here Friday. I wish he would have mentioned the need. Could have come up with light. Been talking to him about that bike every day, asking if it will work for getting to work. But he’s been focused on buying a truck, I think.
	2:30 PM	Jason:	I can just drop a light for him at Barbacoa, actually
	2:30 PM	Jason:	I have to drive both ways for gymnastics today since Piper is sick
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	yes, he called me yesterday to go look at one, wanted me to sign and make payments to me...I laughed. I told him when his grades are consistent and he has gotten a license then to discuss. He said “Well you haven’t practiced driving with me” I reminded him I have told him lots of time on the weekends but he is always with friends.
	2:31 PM	Jason:	his excuse to me (actually it was Brenna questioning him) is that he needs to get a new driver’s ed book because the one he has is from last year
	2:31 PM	Jason:	like the traffic laws maybe all changed :)
	2:31 PM	Jessica:	can you message him and work it out. He is saying he thinks my bike has a flat tire..I have no idea
	2:32 PM	Jason:	of course. he knows we’ve been talking about how he’ll commute in relation to the new bike for days in a row now. i guess he just prefers to pester you.
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	pretty much and I no longer have work flexibility 8-5 for all staff now
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	so I have to pre arrange and use my lunch if leaving
	2:33 PM	Jason:	you’re making me want to go grab a beer from the tap in commiseration
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	not nice
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	Dana will be taking Brenna to school on my weeks now
	2:33 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:34 PM	Jason:	i’m having her bike so always an option, if you/her need to go in early, to drop her at the house for her to bike
	2:35 PM	Jessica:	if we run into a jam, works for now because Dana is working evenings so is home, will drop her then workout
	2:37 PM	Jason:	No answers from Hunter. How was he chatting. Facebook has been working fine with him the last few days.
	2:37 PM	Jason:	?
	2:38 PM	Jason:	nvm, he just answered
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	Always through sms
	2:51 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:03 PM	Jessica:	Hunter was absent the first 3 periods of school today and tardy to the 4th
	6:04 PM	Jason:	What the hell. He was home last night. I’ll start making sure he’s up.
	6:04 PM	Jason:	Was hoping we weren’t still there.
	6:09 PM	Jessica:	I sent him a message, you’re on it
	6:09 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:09 PM	Jason:	At work dinner now. I’ll check in with him later.
	6:10 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Wednesday, August 29, 2018

	7:56 AM	Jason:	FYI, went to get hunter up for waffles and he’s already gone so hopefully no absences today
	8:00 AM	Jessica:	Hopefully
	8:00 AM	Jessica:	Funny thing, it’s Wednesday so late start
	8:04 AM	Jason:	Oh that could be funny
	8:04 AM	Jason:	Or he went to friends after I was in bed
	8:05 AM	Jessica:	That would be a top guess
	8:05 AM	Jason:	True
	12:16 PM	Jessica:	Paperwork approved, Hunter signs on the 10th. Has to be at MEPS building at 5:40 am
	12:16 PM	Jason:	yea
	12:16 PM	Jason:	(not for the AM part)
	12:18 PM	Jessica:	very true, I think the actual signing ceremony stuff must be later in the day
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	as soon as that happens, they start being all over him about grades..thank god. I already let him know there are 6 missing algebra assignments
	12:20 PM	Jason:	i asked him about school yesterday. got the usual “fine”. seems not to be doing any homework, though.
	12:20 PM	Jason:	gets home at 1:30 so has lots of time
	12:21 PM	Jason:	will be nice to let others hound him about it
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	yes, others he will actually listen to, he may have a chance at graduating
	12:21 PM	Jason:	right. he’s really at-risk at this point.
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	maybe light at the end of the tunnel, fingers crossed
	12:26 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:19 PM	Jessica:	Brenna wasn’t picked up for gymnastics, she biked home
	4:20 PM	Jason:	what the hell
	4:20 PM	Jason:	“I can bring or pick up wed”
	4:21 PM	Jason:	“If you can bring them tomorrow, that would be great."
	4:21 PM	Jessica:	Message her
	4:21 PM	Jason:	will do
	4:50 PM	Jason:	I don’t understand the point of these questions from your attorney. I don’t see that they do much to resolve what I thought was the only outstanding issue: what rule does the Court apply to home equity in our case?
	5:12 PM	Jessica:	I told you that’s the way it would go when you chose to make it a fault divorce basing it on adultery, as if the cause of our marriage dissolving was for that reason. I didn’t open that can of worms or try and make it personal. That was your choice, I have twice recommended an attorney mediator, which you have not been open to.
	5:14 PM	Jason:	I told you I would let my attorney know to rescind that approach, which is exactly what I did on July 19 at 7:14 PM (looking at copy of message to paralegal), the same day we talked about it.
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	well he didn’t
	5:15 PM	Jason:	Actually sent to both paralegal and attorney himself to be sure it was seen. Usually send only to paralegal.
	5:15 PM	Jason:	Well, maybe it makes sense to amend whatever it is to make that right and avoid the ugly.
	5:17 PM	Jason:	I was very specific in my message. I said we’d reached a partial, verbal agreement at 4:30 PM that day.
	5:17 PM	Jason:	To split custody, not do fault.
	5:18 PM	Jessica:	I agree, this is not the path I wanted to go down. It’s difficult enough to go back and forth and possibly trial on the numbers. There was no reason for this.
	5:19 PM	Jason:	Okay, I’ll send a MORE CLEAR message to the firm. Presumably yours would have different “interrogatives” (when “question” just doesn’t have enough syllables) in that case. Or maybe none.
	5:22 PM	Jessica:	No, none for me. I’m not denying what I did so nothing to prove. It’s a matter of proving it was not the reason for our marriage falling apart, that it was not solely my fault. Which is what your attorney is trying to claim.
	5:24 PM	Jason:	Okay. I haven’t met with them since before that July 19 date so don’t know what conversation our attorneys may have had. I know they’re acquainted and right across the street from each other. And did see some stuff on my invoice about them talking. Anyway, let’s nip that in the bud.
	5:28 PM	Jessica:	My attorney talked to him and warned him this would happen and to speak with you and explain if you really wanted to go down this path. That’s why I talked to you and was surprised it had been over a week and he hadn’t relayed that conversation to you. By this point assumed you did. Agreed, no reason for this and all the extra attorneys fees. It’s already getting expensive. That was a waste of money.
	5:29 PM	Jason:	I haven’t heard anything from them. Maybe there was a call I didn’t answer but the paralegal sends me message regularly so I doubt that’s a factor.
	5:30 PM	Jason:	I will get confirmation this time that my intent is understood
	5:30 PM	Jessica:	Sounds good. Speak with Deborah?
	5:30 PM	Jason:	Messaged. No answer.
	5:31 PM	Jason:	One-sentence paragraph in my message to them: “I wish to amend my response to the initial filing to accept the no-fault divorce basis of irreconcilable differences."
	5:31 PM	Jessica:	Sometimes irritated with the carpooling. She’s been left a few times now
	5:31 PM	Jason:	Seems clear
	5:31 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s really lame
	5:31 PM	Jason:	Brenna was upset, of course
	5:32 PM	Jessica:	yes, that’s clear and honestly that makes me feel a lot better that you tried. I have been sick over this stupid thing.
	5:32 PM	Jason:	well yeah. we agreed. i made a clear mark of the date and time in my message to them to emphasize its “officialness”
	5:34 PM	Jessica:	of course you did 😂
	5:38 PM	Jason:	Sent message. Concluded, “can you please confirm this is understood?"
	5:44 PM	Jason:	Brenna outside singing. It’s really terrible. Sometimes she’s good. Not this time.
	5:45 PM	Jessica:	one sec
	5:50 PM	Jason:	heading to play frisbee at bagley. she’s getting really good. my legs were sore from running after we played there on the weekend.
	5:51 PM	Jessica:	I was about to say regarding the singing...at least not the violin practicing
	5:59 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:00 PM	Jessica:	awwwe
	6:03 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:19 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:20 PM	Jessica:	Sap is all I can think of
	6:23 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:23 PM	Jason:	Sap
	6:24 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, have fun getting that off her... And out of her hair
	6:46 PM	Jason:	Brenna not so keen on sharing park attention
	6:46 PM	Jason:	Just me and those two
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	You’re cornered
	8:30 PM	Jason:	She explained at dinner that having Ava along got her thinking about the possibility of step family, which really upset her. And she doesn’t want to live in separate homes anymore.
	8:33 PM	Jessica:	Not sure how Ava brings that up exactly in her mind, but definitely breaks my heart as she goes through the realities of all this.
	8:34 PM	Jason:	She said Ava made her think of having a step sister
	8:38 PM	Jessica:	Ahhh, gotcha. She probably doesn’t realize we’re to old to be starting over with anyone with young kids. I for one can’t even imagine that. She’s the last one I want to raise, finally getting close to most out of the house 😂
	8:40 PM	Jessica:	Do you think we should have her start taking to someone or family counceling to help though this?
	8:40 PM	Jessica:	Talking
	8:40 PM	Jason:	Yes
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	I’ve mentioned it to her before but she’s been shut down about it
	8:41 PM	Jason:	And I’m happy to work on the thing she wishes for most
	8:44 PM	Jessica:	I can’t even respond to that. So much damage. Spending the last few weeks pouring through history, emails, conversations... horribly painful and humiliating. The stuff my lawyer through at you was not just painful on your side. It was a deeply hurtful reminder of many things.
	8:44 PM	Jessica:	Threw .damn auto correct
	8:45 PM	Jason:	They were odd “interrogatories” since none were related to the issues you cited for irreconcilability ... that’s why I wondered about them
	8:46 PM	Jessica:	I’m confused by that statement
	8:47 PM	Jason:	Probably best to leave it
	8:54 PM	Jason:	Still no answer from Deborah
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Just to be clear, the lack of intimacy and causes behind that you’re saying we never discussed?
	9:02 PM	Jessica:	weird on Deborah, I’ll message her
	9:02 PM	Jason:	sure, we discussed, but the lawyer questions were almost entirely unrelated to that
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	some, agreed..financial stuff which I think was template stuff and most already provided in the disclosures so not really an issue. The personal..yes..most definitely. I honestly don’t think you understand the hurt you cause relationship wise with intimacy...not just physical. I think even in this, you want to work it out for Brenna. You want a comfortable family that looks good on the blog. Where you feel comfortable and your needs are met. Yet you don’t see me as a  person, listen to me as partner, or many times treat me as a friend. As you have said, you want a version of me
	9:17 PM	Jason:	I want a happy, free-spirited version of you. Not the frizzy-haired 12-year-old, as you’ve implied. I like to see you laugh and be witty. As for the blog, it has tears and sadness lately. It’s just supposed to be real, literal. I guess if there’s an “image” it’s meant to convey, it’s adventure. I enjoyed the months before you moved out, spending more intimate time with you.
	9:28 PM	Jessica:	You had that version, and you made me feel worthless, judged, never enough. Your pictures, your blog, your debates, your rides... always worth more of your time. Intimately, well we know how that went. The end all was the fact that when I talk with you, communicate I will be ignored. I never cared about the money for the damn motorcycle. It’s that you made it clear my thoughts don’t count. Nothing of importance to me counts if it’s not important to you.
	9:30 PM	Jessica:	even in this, there was no effort to fix. only because it effects Brenna, and finances or I doubt you would care
	9:36 PM	Jason:	I am sorry it seems that way. Before the separation, I thought we were both giving as much effort as we could (as broken people). I loved being more connected with you.
	10:08 PM	Jessica:	I’m going to leave the conversation here for now. I feel like any response I have will not be conducive to any agreement or resolution. I am so tired of being hurt, of bringing up hurt.

Thursday, August 30, 2018

	7:27 AM	Jessica:	Hunter coming to talk to you...I can’t even
	7:28 AM	Jason:	About to hop in shower. Shall I go see what’s up instead?
	7:28 AM	Jessica:	Yep
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	Do I need to email the school regarding Hunter?
	9:27 AM	Jason:	Oh, I guess so. He said he’d thrown up. Obviously zero credibility but claimed he was only going to miss first two classes which didn’t have any work due.
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	the 10th can’t come soon enough......
	9:27 AM	Jason:	His bike is scheduled to be here today so maybe he’ll be motivated for, like ... a day
	9:28 AM	Jason:	I’m curious to see how much we have to put it together. Will be good man time.
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	just don’t give him a beer ;)
	9:28 AM	Jason:	He’ll use his own money (supposedly) to by the bike lights and bling
	9:29 AM	Jason:	I know, waste of beer since he doesn’t actually drink it.
	9:29 AM	Jason:	*to buy
	9:29 AM	Jessica:	good point
	9:31 AM	Jessica:	Deborah did message me when I messaged her last night. Piper still sick.  I told her maybe there was miscommunication but Brenna was stuck waiting a long time until finally going home and missing gymnastics.
	9:32 AM	Jessica:	She said she didn’t realize you thought she was getting them because Piper sick but probably her mess up. Also she thought Brenna would realize Pipe not as school. Which is silly to me since they are in different grades and classes. Ugh
	9:41 AM	Jason:	Yeah, I knew she was sick Tuesday, so obviously I drove both ways, but the last message about Wednesday was that what I shared ... she could do either drive so I  asked her to bring.
	9:42 AM	Jason:	She never replied to my message. It was friendly, like, “oops, maybe I misunderstood ..."
	9:43 AM	Jessica:	yeah, she is similar to Lee sometimes I feel..a bit scattered when it comes to communicating/arranging
	9:47 AM	Jason:	I don’t know what their days are like but maybe it’s harder if your job doesn’t involve being at a computer.
	9:52 AM	Jessica:	no clue, I can say we have never forgotten a pick up or left one of their kids!
	10:39 AM	Jason:	Yes, I would be horrified at the thought
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	forwarded you the email my lawyer sent yours this morning since he can’t copy you on it.
	10:51 AM	Jason:	Sounds correct. Thank you.
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	well if all of us mail your lawyer maybe he’ll pay attention ;)
	11:58 AM	Jason:	the paralegal acknowledged my message from yesterday and said she will coordinate with the attorney
	11:59 AM	Jessica:	oh good
	6:59 PM	Jason:	Watching foreign language crime show. Lead investigator has emotional problems.
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	Shocking😂 drinks with Melissa and Lori
	7:06 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:06 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:06 PM	Jason:	Our sweet garden tomatoes
	8:06 PM	Jason:	Trying to get kids to eat them
	8:13 PM	Jessica:	Yummy!!!!
	8:13 PM	Jason:	I’ll try to get some to you tomorrow. Way too many here.
	8:28 PM	Jessica:	Definitely I’ll take some
	8:29 PM	Jason:	Ava liked hers, I think, but not Brenna
	8:29 PM	Jason:	And I eat some every time I go by. They’re sweet, almost like grapes.
	8:30 PM	Jessica:	Yeah.... Brenna hates tomatoes. Hunter likes them like that, cherry tomatoes, just not cooked
	8:32 PM	Jason:	His bike didn’t arrive like the e-mail said but I guess he wasn’t here anyway. Hopefully he’ll have time tomorrow or soon to put it together with me.
	8:47 PM	Jessica:	He works till close tomorrow which is late. Maybe Saturday? Going to take Brenna to McCall to Kim’s cabin so he can stay there, but if you have things know Dana is here to keep an eye on him, so not alone here
	8:48 PM	Jessica:	He also works Saturday night
	8:48 PM	Jason:	Okay. I have no plans. I can put the bike together myself, of course, but intend to have him do most the work while I help.
	8:48 PM	Jessica:	Make him help
	8:49 PM	Jason:	Maybe I’ll see if he wants to ride up to Idaho City or something. He probably has plans but we’ll see.
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	Plan on being back Sunday, Jessica wants to get girls together. Forgot Monday off originally
	8:51 PM	Jessica:	He can’t do anything with friends if assignments not in
	8:51 PM	Jason:	Oh, good point. Pretty sure they won’t be since, well, they never have been.
	8:51 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	8:52 PM	Jessica:	He has Sunday Monday off
	8:52 PM	Jason:	me too
	8:53 PM	Jessica:	Good time to build bike and get algebra done
	8:54 PM	Jason:	Yep. Putting the “labor” in Labor Day
	8:56 PM	Jessica:	He wanted me to drop some clothes off tonight but it seemed to be about some leggings of Dallas’s I’m not driving over for that just home
	8:57 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:58 PM	Jason:	uh
	8:58 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:58 PM	Jason:	are you at zepole?
	8:58 PM	Jason:	is that you’re art?
	8:58 PM	Jason:	*your
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	Melissa just sent, girls drew 😂
	8:59 PM	Jason:	oh jeez
	8:59 PM	Jason:	it’s what’s at the end of the rainbow 😒
	9:00 PM	Jessica:	3 balls I guess
	9:56 PM	Jessica:	I’m planning on picking up from gymnastics tomorrow?
	9:57 PM	Jason:	Sure, if that’s easiest for you.
	9:58 PM	Jessica:	Sounds good, planned on it. Hopefully taking is arranged
	9:58 PM	Jason:	Yes, Deborah confirmed she’s taking.
	10:11 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:18 PM	Jason:	Warning: she needs an npr story every night at bedtime now
	10:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	10:20 PM	Jessica:	Can you have her pack the Russian fairytale book I got her. I’d  like to read that with her
	10:22 PM	Jason:	Relayed
	10:22 PM	Jessica:	Thanks

Friday, August 31, 2018

	8:01 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:01 AM	Jason:	So that’s Friday
	8:04 AM	Jessica:	Oh crap!
	8:39 AM	Jason:	Not to overthink but cards on the table: I was messaging you less and less because you seemed to be getting colder and colder towards me, which I infer now was because you thought I was pursuing the fault claim. So trying to roll back to something more normal.
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	I appreciate that. I struggle with the comfort level of normally chatting with you and our normal conversation rhythm mixed with hurt and frustration when you then do what feels to me to be very passive aggressive actions at times. It’s tricky, I miss our friendship but feel the need to create boundaries and be guarded many times, it’s a difficult transition / dilemma, how to keep the good parts of our relationship while the rest is ending.
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	two more weeks of internet hell....
	9:08 AM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	We’ve been down the last two. It works on and off so constantly interrupts work when in a web based app. Very frustrating..I’m sick of seeing a spinning wheel and error messages
	9:11 AM	Jason:	That’s terrible. We just stop working when stuff like that happens. Probably less of an option there.
	9:11 AM	Jason:	You sound like the DMV
	9:14 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, all new equipment coming, ask new fiber cabling being laid... But has to be custom ordered. I get way more done working at home but they want us here
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	Just got a call from the assistant principal
	10:46 AM	Jason:	Assume about hunter
	10:46 AM	Jessica:	yep, he was absent first and second period today as well and late to third
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	he can’t have more than 9 absences in a class per semester or they drop it which will impact graduating
	10:47 AM	Jason:	Jeez. Okay, I’ll just need to go up there every morning.
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	he has saturday school being scheduled because I only excused yesterday and the 23rd so it’s a truancy
	10:49 AM	Jason:	I’ll make sure he makes it. You’ll get the time details?
	10:49 AM	Jason:	He should only have missed first two periods yesterday.
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:51 AM	Jessica:	I didn’t get the details on the Saturday thing, not sure if it’s for tomorrow or next
	10:52 AM	Jason:	Is he not returning to school after lunch sometimes?
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	9 missing assignments. 1 English, 8 Algebra
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	no clue on the lunch thing
	10:53 AM	Jason:	Which has to mean he’s making no effort at all in math
	10:53 AM	Jason:	Weird because he’s pretty good at it
	10:54 AM	Jason:	Sounds like we’re having a homework weekend either way
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	yep
	10:56 AM	Jason:	I guess I’ll do the thing where I tell him to sit downstairs with me and work. He knows these days he can decline and I haven’t much recourse. But maybe it will work.
	10:57 AM	Jessica:	I think it’s just not optional. He goes nowhere, has no devices until stuff done
	10:58 AM	Jessica:	I’ll let him know he has to turn his phone/laptop in for the weekend or until all assignments done that you have verified
	10:58 AM	Jason:	Algebra is easy, for him as well as me. Hopefully we can knock it out.
	11:00 AM	Jason:	I mean, though that he seems to have no compunction about ignoring consequences, sneaking out anyway, whatever. With just him and I here, I’ll work to stay on top of him.
	11:00 AM	Jessica:	they look like little assignments 5 pts
	11:01 AM	Jason:	Oh good
	11:01 AM	Jason:	Even weirder he didn’t do them then
	11:03 AM	Jessica:	he’s to lazy
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Hunter did not go home, is not returning calls or texts, is at Barbacoa but not working
	4:17 PM	Jason:	:( Doesn’t he work at 4:00?
	4:18 PM	Jessica:	I called they told me he had just walked in but that he is not working tonight
	4:20 PM	Jason:	Well that’s weird. I hope he’s still employed there. I’m a bit at a loss about what to do. Certainly when I see him at home I’ll make sure he stays. Do you have a thought?
	4:24 PM	Jessica:	I think he is on lock down until he does his signing and consistency. I plan on going by there after work to get him and take him to your house. I turned off his phone.
	4:25 PM	Jessica:	I am also wondering if he is still working there and if so and he continues, I think we need the weekly schedule, not what he tells us. I am going to talk to his boss
	4:27 PM	Jason:	Okay. I have no weekend plans other than house chores (mowing, vacuuming, etc.) so don’t mind at all hanging out with Hunter to keep him on task.
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	Okay and I’m back Sunday and deliver him to school so at least I know that will happen next week.
	4:34 PM	Jason:	That’s a quick McCall trip. Is there an event up there?
	4:36 PM	Jessica:	no just going to Kim’s cabin. I don’t want to be gone the whole weekend. Brenna bringing Delaney. Leave in the morning back Sunday afternoon. The girls can play on the floaties and paddleboards and a boat ride
	5:10 PM	Jason:	Sounds nice
	5:11 PM	Jason:	Scratchy still here
	5:32 PM	Jason:	Deborah is picking up Piper early for a vacation so it will just be Brenna to pick up. Brenna probably mentioned her shoulder has bothered her. I know about that all too well. We iced it last night. I told her not to use it if it’s still bothering her, though.
	5:45 PM	Jessica:	Okay
. Funny Hunter said same
	5:46 PM	Jason:	That his shoulder hurt?
	5:49 PM	Jessica:	Yep couple days ago
	5:50 PM	Jason:	Maybe a hard day in lifetime sports. I guess he isn’t doing weight training any more. He was telling Kayla, Brenna and I that he wants to start la cross.
	6:01 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	6:04 PM	Jessica:	Get any morning balloon pics?
	6:05 PM	Jason:	I saw them while biking but wouldn’t have been great photos with phone. Here’s one from the office ...
	6:06 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:06 PM	Jessica:	Better than mine
	6:07 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	6:07 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	6:07 PM	Jason:	Yeah, true :)
	6:07 PM	Jason:	Brenna has been liking JUMP visits to climb the pyramid. We race to the top. I think we’re tied, 3 to 3. Then she did 112 cartwheels around the amphitheater.
	6:08 PM	Jason:	We’ve gone twice.
	6:08 PM	Jessica:	Oh nice
	6:09 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:09 PM	Jessica:	That’s funny
	6:09 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	6:11 PM	Jason:	There was a cosplay event the first time. Brenna had to explain to me what that was.
	6:11 PM	Jessica:	Not as painful as I was expecting
	6:11 PM	Jessica:	The dogs will be thrilled 😂
	6:12 PM	Jason:	She hasn’t brought it back home yet
	6:13 PM	Jessica:	Wonder if she does on Friday’s
	6:13 PM	Jason:	I bought her a bunch of carabiners and we figured out how to hook the case to her backpack (it’s really light) easily
	6:14 PM	Jessica:	Macgyver
	6:15 PM	Jason:	Yeah. I wasn’t going to be tricked into driving to school every day.
	6:16 PM	Jessica:	Good point
	6:16 PM	Jason:	She found a friend to bike with and was meeting her for the first time this morning. I actually offered a ride and she didn’t want one. I haven’t heard yet if it worked out, though.
	6:17 PM	Jason:	She said they agreed to bike home together as far as they could and discovered it was almost all the way.
	6:17 PM	Jessica:	So are you just getting her bike on gymnastics days?
	6:17 PM	Jason:	Yeah, like last year
	6:18 PM	Jason:	Bike is here
	6:18 PM	Jessica:	Hunter’s arrive?
	6:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:20 PM	Jason:	Not too much assembly needed
	6:21 PM	Jessica:	Not to bad, bets on how long till his first flat? 😂
	6:22 PM	Jason:	First week, I’m sure. He’s supposed to be buying lights, etc., with own money. Should grab extra tubes then too.
	6:22 PM	Jason:	Kind of surprised he wanted BMX bike (no gears) but he was certain
	6:22 PM	Jason:	Must see himself doing stunts
	6:23 PM	Jessica:	Sounds about right
	6:26 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:26 PM	Jason:	The time I won
	6:27 PM	Jessica:	To bad no pictures of that
	6:27 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:28 PM	Jessica:	Oh jeez
	6:28 PM	Jason:	She won every time climbing up through the inside then I figured out you could climb up the outside (a little scarier) and have no ropes to work through.
	6:28 PM	Jason:	Then I got angry face
	6:28 PM	Jessica:	Of course you did 😂
	6:29 PM	Jason:	You would have done the same
	6:29 PM	Jessica:	Most likely!
	6:30 PM	Jason:	I’ll let her know you’re up for some pyramid races
	6:30 PM	Jessica:	Ummmmm 🤔
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Don’t try it in bare feet. The ropes hurt.
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Flip-flops are also tricky.
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Those are all my tips.
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Good luck.
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	Soooo helpful 🤨
	6:32 PM	Jason:	Oh, we have a few new games at the park that other kids seemed to think were a bit violent that we can tell you about later.
	6:32 PM	Jason:	Time for troubled nordic lead inspector, I think
	6:34 PM	Jessica:	Oh great...more bruises
	6:35 PM	Jason:	You have to lay on your back underneath them swinging for one
	6:35 PM	Jessica:	Hell no
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	Did she shower last night or needs to tonight?
	9:10 PM	Jason:	Pretty sure she did last night. Has every other night.
	9:15 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀

Saturday, September 1, 2018

	11:05 AM	Jason:	Woah, Hunter built bike last night. Kinda cool.
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	Nice!!!
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	Heading out to McCall
	11:10 AM	Jessica:	More impressive if all assignments get done
	11:10 AM	Jason:	Drive safe. Probably crazy people out today.
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:17 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:18 AM	Jason:	ready for fun
	11:18 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:18 AM	Jason:	pajamas
	3:04 PM	Jason:	Did you try those tomatoes?
	3:09 PM	Jessica:	A couple.
	3:09 PM	Jason:	Good review
	3:10 PM	Jason:	;)
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	They were good, fresh always are
	3:31 PM	Jason:	I’ve always preferred positive tomato reviews
	3:58 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:58 PM	Jason:	Gold chains
	3:58 PM	Jessica:	Seriously can’t deal with you anymore. Obviously never fixed accounts
	3:59 PM	Jason:	What?
	4:00 PM	Jason:	I don’t know what you mean. When I saw you were transferring money between accounts, I thought all was well.
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	As long as I have the internet log in which uses my fingerprint. Phone in a dead area so could transfer, so had to call..but not on those accounts so... guess you never fixed that as agreed.  You were specifically told to keep the accounts joint until this resolved. It’s like the taxes, you remove me and then dole out a piece at a time if needed when you should never have removed me to begin with. This shit is why I’m cold to you... Exact passive/aggressive example I mean.
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Like I said, when I saw you were regularly making transfers, I thought it was resolved. I figured the only way you could transfer is if you had normal access so believed there was nothing left to do. Wasn’t about reneging on agreement at all.
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	Just NVM. Seriously not worth my time anymore
	4:10 PM	Jason:	I have wanted specifically to be transparent and fair. Gave you spreadsheet, asked it if seemed right.
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	After removing me from joint accounts, folders, spreadsheets. Go to hell
	4:13 PM	Jason:	I want to be fair but I also need to pay bills
	4:13 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	Yes I will that as well. Not even worth the time to comment. Believe me, I want nothing more than to be done with this, finances, all of it and never have to talk to you again other than when needed for kids.
	4:17 PM	Jason:	:(
	4:32 PM	Jessica:	Whatever Jason. You’re sad when it effects you, yet can’t manage to be aware of anybody else’s feeling or be a human being. You live in a  reality only you comprehend.. where only what makes you feel something matters. Wanting to be friends while at the exact time taking actions to destroy it. You don’t get it both ways.
	4:39 PM	Jason:	I’m sad because you’ve seemed stuck for a while in a mode that assumes the worst of others, whether me or other family or friends. It’s an unhappy way to be that seems often to make you angry.
	4:48 PM	Jessica:	I think it’s sad you have no friends or people that truly know you to check you or bring you to an understanding of how other people may be feeling and thinking. I’m fine drawing boundaries with people, does it hurt yes, do I assume the worst of them no...I look at their actions, is it a healthy relationship to have in my life, is it one sided? That’s left me with many positive friends, family and support system around me. That’s left me doing weekly work on myself. With healthy relationships in my life that do call me out when needed and i love them for it because I trust them, because I know they care, because it’s not all about them. You do nothing but judge those around you while never taking any responsibility for your actions, just telling people your sad that were hurt by you. I think that’s pathetic
	4:50 PM	Jason:	I am glad you feel supported and able to develop your best self.
	4:51 PM	Jessica:	Point made
	5:39 PM	Jessica:	You need to call the card number in for the competition account on Tues. It’s encrypted so can’t copy it over from the monthly. Just spoke with her.
	6:17 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:18 PM	Jason:	Glad it’s encrypted
	7:36 PM	Jason:	We’ve been working on it several hours and Hunter just finished his algebra.
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	The software is
	7:39 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:39 PM	Jason:	It was easy for him. He just had to do it. He had a few questions but immediately understood when I demonstrated.
	7:41 PM	Jason:	We also got his bike fixed. He didn’t realize the pedals are reverse threaded and had used vice grips to force them. Almost ruined but able to fix.
	7:41 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, he’s smart with that stuff, just lazy is what hurts him. I’ll send you the numbers for Kayla’s college this year for the spreadsheet. Have it set for monthly payments over 10 months while we figure out divorce. 405 euros starting October

Sunday, September 2, 2018

	10:51 AM	Jessica:	What’s the iccu password?
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	?
	12:39 PM	Jason:	There isn’t such a thing as “the password.” ICCU only has personal logins. As a token of transparency, I shared my personal login with you this spring. Your side of the same token was to allow review of your SMS history. The point of that transparency, however, was lost when the objective became divorce.

Depending on how much longer divorce resolution might take, I propose mediation around financial issues. If you think allocations are unfair, we can work that out. I was sort of thinking about mediation anyway based on the graph I shared.
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	The point is, you were legally barred from removing me from joint accounts and access. Fix it. There is a restraining order in place. I have no problem with mediation, I’ve mentioned it twice nie
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	Now*
	12:44 PM	Jessica:	I need to be able to get gas and food
	12:45 PM	Jason:	Why didn’t you get paid?
	12:45 PM	Jessica:	I did, it’s less because of no PTO and I paid rent.
	12:47 PM	Jason:	And you chose to travel and dine out assuming you could pull money from my equal allocation?
	12:47 PM	Jason:	Don’t you realize how insane that is?
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	I was already committed to the travel which I spoke with you about, we discussed that I may need help with that which I didn’t ask for. I have pulled 100 from this week’s allocation.
	12:49 PM	Jason:	Yeah, it looks like I have extra money but that’s because I cover almost $5,000 a month in bills.
	12:49 PM	Jason:	You had already pulled some $1,200 in the last few weeks.
	12:50 PM	Jason:	Much was for school supplies, yes, but the reason you couldn’t chip in was because you’d already spent your money elsewhere.
	12:50 PM	Jessica:	And yes, having Kayla here did mean eating out a couple times
	12:50 PM	Jason:	Of course I’ll give you money but this is a problem that needs mediation, I think.
	12:50 PM	Jason:	The spreadsheet has data for months.
	12:50 PM	Jessica:	Everything was for school supplies and shopping
	12:50 PM	Jessica:	For that Chunk
	12:52 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, in the meantime you still are required to give me the same access
	12:57 PM	Jason:	Yes, you have the same access you had at the beginning of this year and all of last year, etc. If your personal login isn’t seeing some things then I can go into the bank Tuesday to ensure you’re able to view those accounts.
	12:57 PM	Jason:	I think I mentioned I tried to take myself off your account (I see no need to interfere with your money) but couldn’t since I’m primary.
	12:58 PM	Jessica:	You removed me from a joint account... Not allowed
	12:59 PM	Jason:	That was before you filed
	1:00 PM	Jason:	It made sense to remove you from my account and remove me from yours as a step to separation
	1:02 PM	Jessica:	I’ll review with my lawyer. I’ve had the same access since and you’ve been aware of. That I now no longer do is an issue.
	1:03 PM	Jason:	I wrote above, “If your personal login isn’t seeing some things then I can go into the bank Tuesday to ensure you’re able to view those accounts."
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	One again I need to be able to get had/food. As for your spreadsheet, you have no clue what half the things are for some we don’t communicate
	1:04 PM	Jason:	I think reviewing with attorneys or mediator is a good idea, though, since you seem to believe you can take money from my budget anytime you want.
	1:04 PM	Jason:	Yes, but you only get yourself in a bind because you spend so much on leisure.
	1:04 PM	Jessica:	I told you I needed same access to all the accounts, after filling. Hunter’s, morgtgage, billing etc. You agreed to make sure I did and up until today that was the case
	1:05 PM	Jason:	I haven’t changed anything at the bank in months. I don’t know why you had access a few days ago and not today.
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	And you spend so much on motorcycle gear...
	1:05 PM	Jason:	My spending is planned and budgeted so I don’t ever have to take money from your account.
	1:06 PM	Jason:	I don’t suddenly find myself out of money to buy food or school supplies. Again, that’s an insane way to use money.
	1:07 PM	Jason:	You can’t use my budget as your slush fund. Mediation
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	Once again, no communication
	1:07 PM	Jason:	I have record of lots of communication. “Do these numbers look right?" etc.
	1:08 PM	Jason:	I don’t have a record of you saying, “oh, heads-up, I need to spend X and will need to split”
	1:08 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, done arguing. Please transfer rest of allocation. We can deal with lawyers etc this week
	1:08 PM	Jason:	I will gift you some money but you already more than withdrew allocation for leisure.
	1:15 PM	Jason:	Sent $250
	1:27 PM	Jessica:	Leaving here shortly once girls done with sandcastle so will get Hunter when back. I’ll be over Wednesday while Brenna at gymnastics to start getting more of my things
	1:28 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:52 PM	Jason:	Hunter at nearby buddies (Jordan?). Let him know the plan. He said he’d text once
	2:52 PM	Jason:	... over there.
	4:41 PM	Jessica:	Does he have his phone?
	4:41 PM	Jason:	Yeah, just for that since he finished the Algebra
	4:42 PM	Jason:	No service, of course
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	English done?
	4:47 PM	Jason:	I didn’t check that. Actually forgot. Sorry.
	4:47 PM	Jason:	Focused so long on math ...

Monday, September 3, 2018

	1:08 PM	Jason:	Hunter said he talked to you to get permission to stay at Josh’s last night. He’s back here now. I told him he needs to work on English but don’t know the plan for him to go there, so not sure how much to get him going on ... ?
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Yes he had permission. Has to do the English before going anywhere
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Was told to come here
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	I can get him anytime or if he has plans with friends he can get English done there before leaving
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	We need to start counseling for Brenna
	1:22 PM	Jason:	Whatever works best for you as far as Hunter. Just wanted to be on the same page.
	1:22 PM	Jason:	Do you have a counselor recommendation? And are you saying that generally or did she talk to you about something?
	1:24 PM	Jessica:	She talked to me.
	1:27 PM	Jason:	I am happy to pursue a counselor recommendation if you don’t have one.
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	She wants us to stay married, seems to think it’s on me because you told her you don’t want to get divorced.
	1:31 PM	Jason:	Of course she wants that. This tears her world up. But I actually told her it’s complicated and not to think we’ll stay married.
	1:56 PM	Jessica:	I mentioned her going, she said no. I then said it might be nice to talk with somebody and say how you feel that’s not mom or dad. That I see someone every week. She asked to go with me
	1:56 PM	Jason:	I asked Hunter if he wanted to work on the assignment here or there and he said there. I can run him over if that’s easier.
	1:57 PM	Jason:	Of course she can go with you once to see what it’s like but I’d rather she have a different counselor.
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	Sure, if you could drop him in about an hour that would be helpful
	2:01 PM	Jason:	Oh, you aren’t there yet?
	2:01 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, hoping maybe just going with will have the way. I’ll see if my counselor has any recommendations
	2:02 PM	Jason:	I’ll have him pack his stuff. His papers are scattered all over the living room so maybe it will take an hour anyway. :)
	2:04 PM	Jessica:	I am about to run a couple errands. Dana here horribly sick. Want to be here to be on him to immediately do the assignment
	2:05 PM	Jason:	Gotcha. Bummer about being sick. I’ll drop him around 3:00.
	2:05 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:06 PM	Jessica:	Praying we don’t get it
	2:08 PM	Jason:	stomach?
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	Yes, fever puking
	8:40 PM	Jessica:	Leave Brenna’s bike out tomorrow please, she may bike.
	8:40 PM	Jason:	Will do

Tuesday, September 4, 2018

	8:17 AM	Jason:	Brennas bike is missing
	8:27 AM	Jason:	Found it
	8:45 AM	Jessica:	Ava’s,  she knew that before I left
	9:05 AM	Jason:	Well, that’s what she said but we were both blanking out whole days. I hadn’t picked it up from school Friday. Totally forgot.
	9:08 AM	Jason:	I’ll get Hunter lights and lock today at McCu’s and he can pay me back, per our deal. Probably get combo lock, if available, so key isn’t lost.
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	Oh, so it was at school?
	9:55 AM	Jason:	Yes. We went and got it.
	10:00 AM	Jason:	I can pick it up after work
	10:02 AM	Jessica:	that’s fine she shouldn’t need it tomorrow. Just did not want Dana to bring her with how sick she is
	10:03 AM	Jason:	yeah, of course
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	You need to immediately give me the banking log in information. I spoke with my lawyer, it is a clear contempt of court and he will file today if not resolved immediately. All accounts are considered community property currently and I can’t be barred from seeing them.
	10:37 AM	Jason:	Did you describe that I haven’t made any change to the accounts since before you filed? And you’ve had access this whole time? And I already said I would go into the bank today?
	10:37 AM	Jason:	It doesn’t sound like it.
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	yes, and actually just by closing the joint billing would be considered a violation. I am to be able to view all accounts (mortgage, HELOC etc). I don’t recall you saying you would go into the bank,  maybe I missed that in the messaging. Not sure why you would need to when it’s just log in info.
	10:46 AM	Jason:	except we both agreed to that. i was careful to get your agreement in writing.
	10:46 AM	Jessica:	we also agreed I would have access to all accounts
	10:46 AM	Jason:	it seems like you’re not reading what I’ve been writing
	10:46 AM	Jason:	(it makes me glad it is in writing)
	10:47 AM	Jason:	I already had to repeat this to you once before: 'I wrote above, “If your personal login isn’t seeing some things then I can go into the bank Tuesday to ensure you’re able to view those accounts."'
	10:49 AM	Jessica:	My personal log in won’t show me everything since I’m not on everything, but I still am allowed to see everything as it’s all considered community property currently.
	10:49 AM	Jason:	That’s the reason I will go to the bank. To ensure you can view the other accounts.
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	so why not just give me the sign in info?
	10:51 AM	Jason:	there is no “the” sign in info. there’s my personal login and your personal login
	10:53 AM	Jason:	I’d prefer that online account activity reflect who is actually doing the transaction. Not to mention the usual security advice around sharing personal passwords.
	10:54 AM	Jessica:	Let me know when resolved.
	10:55 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:00 PM	Jessica:	We just got reminders about our HRA accounts. If there are any bills from your foot stuff that weren’t covered...that had to be paid towards deductible I can get it reimbursed as there is still 1000 available to use. Just need the EOB to submit and your checking account # to deposit it to.
	1:01 PM	Jason:	There was a bit. I’ll get the info. Thanks.
	1:18 PM	Jason:	Not sure what an EOB is. There’s one more level of detail I can see.
	1:18 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Explanation of Benefits. I had to go into the details of mine to see it
	1:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:21 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:28 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s on there
	1:28 PM	Jason:	amount billed versus total covered
	1:29 PM	Jason:	off to get hunter bike bits
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	okay, will need the full one for the sheet so that it shows your name on the EOB I think
	1:45 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:45 PM	Jason:	Hunter’s combo for when he forgets
	1:47 PM	Jason:	The first image I sent had my name and the visit IDs that match the other screens. I guess if they can’t figure that out, I’ll skip it. I didn’t know there was a reason to keep the EOBs so haven’t.
	1:49 PM	Jessica:	I’ll try to submit that way
	1:50 PM	Jason:	:) gracias
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	code didn’t show?
	1:51 PM	Jason:	what code?
	1:51 PM	Jessica:	combo
	1:51 PM	Jessica:	my internet is stupid
	1:51 PM	Jason:	the red 1225?
	1:52 PM	Jason:	stupid internet
	2:17 PM	Jessica:	what’s your checking account#
	2:27 PM	Jason:	706070961
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	$#@!
	3:57 PM	Jason:	cartoon swearing usually means it’s kids or computer in trouble
	3:57 PM	Jason:	real swearing means it’s me
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	good point on both
	3:58 PM	Jason:	so ... ? :)
	4:00 PM	Jessica:	Piper’s neck hurt, she rode the bus Deborah looking for Brenna
	4:00 PM	Jason:	oh jeez
	4:00 PM	Jason:	once bitten twice shy
	4:00 PM	Jason:	she probably didn’t wait long
	4:01 PM	Jason:	meaning brenna
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	exactly, I said if her bike’s not there she’s heading to the house. She was going to go there
	4:02 PM	Jason:	good golly
	4:02 PM	Jason:	brenna seems to rightly complain that piper has an excuse every other practice
	4:02 PM	Jessica:	That’s correct. She misses constantly
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	We need to have Brenna keep her gizmo on or activate her phone.
	4:03 PM	Jason:	was just writing that. will take this weekend or sooner if i see her.
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	waiting for text that she has Brenna
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	Going to be a problem if it’s always last minute like this. I have absolutely no leeway on picking up from school now. Even on the two days she doesn’t have gymnastics she is going to have to bike to your house so I can get her after work if Dana not available.
	4:06 PM	Jason:	biking isn’t a bad solution
	4:06 PM	Jason:	at least while weather is okay
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	yeah, not sure what to do once it gets colder. one bridge at a time
	4:07 PM	Jason:	yep
	4:09 PM	Jessica:	she’s been retrieved
	4:13 PM	Jason:	oh good
	4:13 PM	Jason:	had she biked?
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	yep, Deborah got there a few minutes before her, so she definitely didn’t wait more than 5 minutes at the culdesac.
	4:15 PM	Jason:	will hook up phone for her asap
	4:16 PM	Jason:	saves me a bike pickup trip :)
	4:16 PM	Jessica:	very true
	5:43 PM	Jason:	I filled out the account form. I can bring it to you tomorrow. To the same extent that paragraph eight (8) of the property restraining order ensures access to community accounts, paragraph one (1) prohibits us from “transferring” money out of community accounts without “written consent” (I imagine text messages are sufficient).

I am always happy to coordinate to cover unforeseen expenses.
	6:02 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:21 PM	Jessica:	Hunter wants to stay there tonight after work for school. I think had to have a curfew though, it’s his way of avoiding being picked up and home by a certain time I think. He will try and use it to be out late
	10:21 PM	Jessica:	I  can get him though
	10:21 PM	Jason:	It’s fine with me
	10:22 PM	Jason:	He left all his stuff here so I kind of wondered
	10:22 PM	Jason:	Including fast food garbage
	10:22 PM	Jessica:	Of course
	10:23 PM	Jessica:	Should I tell him home by 11:30 then
	10:23 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s fair
	10:23 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:28 PM	Jessica:	Informed him. Reminded him staying there rather than being picked up not an excuse to be out late on school nights. If he tries to take advantage, back to being picked up. He starts this week having weekends off
	10:28 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:29 PM	Jason:	I will make sure he’s up in the morning before I go
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	Reminder, Wednesday late start so he doesn’t start school at 7:45,
	10:29 PM	Jessica:	8:20
	10:29 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:29 PM	Jason:	Was about to say same
	10:31 PM	Jessica:	Dropping Brenna to bike. Still waiting for gymnastics plan confirmation
	10:31 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:32 PM	Jason:	Did lots of maintenance on her bike after riding and noticing weak brakes
	10:32 PM	Jason:	Probably won’t notice
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Should probably get her a lock as well
	10:32 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:35 PM	Jessica:	Going to see about possibility of her riding wings van on gym days. It’s for club kid so not sure it can happen but will ask. Tired of never knowing and no longer can do last minute planning
	10:35 PM	Jason:	Great idea
	11:03 PM	Jessica:	And there it is. Piper probably not going, she may take her to urgent care in the morning but can get Brenna if we’re in a bind
	11:04 PM	Jessica:	Are you able to take her tomorrow? I can do some of your pick ups next week
	11:05 PM	Jason:	Yep
	11:05 PM	Jason:	NPR story. Almost asleep
	11:06 PM	Jessica:	Sorry, trying to figure this out... Really tired of it

Wednesday, September 5, 2018

	12:03 AM	Jessica:	Hunter not there it looks like
	7:42 AM	Jason:	I heard him come in last night and his bike here
	7:45 AM	Jason:	Put bank paperwork under Brenna bike
	7:45 AM	Jason:	Hopping in shower
	4:21 PM	Jessica:	I will have to get more of my stuff another day. To wiped to do it today.
	4:30 PM	Jason:	Too
	4:30 PM	Jason:	Hunter got the day off
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	😡
	4:31 PM	Jessica:	He asked for it or they told him not to come in? Surprised since he has Saturday/Sunday off
	4:32 PM	Jason:	He said the chef said he could take it off since they have enough people
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	ouch, at least he has a C..barely now but got 60% on many of those assignments for being late. Some still show missing
	4:34 PM	Jason:	I’ll check with him
	4:34 PM	Jason:	At least brenna got picked up today
	4:34 PM	Jessica:	oh wait, that was the wrong class i was looking at, still F in Algebra
	4:36 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:36 PM	Jessica:	I know he did that English and submitted, not sure if the math are new or ones you guys did
	4:36 PM	Jason:	I don’t recognize those
	4:37 PM	Jason:	We did a bunch of worksheets
	4:37 PM	Jessica:	I can pick him up when I do the gymnastics pick up
	4:37 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:18 PM	Jason:	Getting the usual -- already did it or doesn’t have the assignment anymore for the four missing algebra assignments.
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	I’ll email his teacher
	5:38 PM	Jason:	Okay, he just did one. He’s checking on the quiz corrections. Doesn’t know where HW6 is. The one he got a zero on (I see it on the counter) isn’t one we did together.
	5:39 PM	Jason:	He got invitations to apply to U.I. and Utah
	5:39 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, standard. You should see all the email invites I’ve been getting
	5:40 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I told him he’ll keep getting them. I remember getting tons.
	5:54 PM	Jessica:	I haven’t seen anything come through from your lawyer, did that get resolved? I know both of ours seem to be rather slow at times so....
	5:55 PM	Jason:	I talked to him today. We seemed to be on same page now.
	5:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:51 PM	Jason:	Has Hunter been in touch?
	7:51 PM	Jason:	He said he was going to go bike with Tanner (?). I said he had to coordinate with yout.
	7:51 PM	Jason:	I listened to podcast and fell asleep (woah).
	7:51 PM	Jason:	Got up. He’s gone, Front door was standing open. Can’t find cat. Hopefully she just fell asleep somewhere too.
	7:56 PM	Jason:	Hmm, still can’t find cat.
	7:57 PM	Jessica:	No he hasn’t
	7:57 PM	Jessica:	Uh oh on cat
	8:03 PM	Jason:	Found cat in Bill’s yard. Took a while for her to come to me. Thank god. Now she’s yeowling.
	8:05 PM	Jason:	I told Hunter you were picking him up around 8:00 (just to be sure he’d be here). No sign of him. Can’t believe he left front door standing wide open.
	8:07 PM	Jessica:	I’ll call him
	8:10 PM	Jessica:	He called just now
	8:10 PM	Jason:	She thinks she’s an outdoor cat now. Giving me attitude.
	8:10 PM	Jason:	He almost killed the cat. I don’t think she’d have lasted long.
	8:10 PM	Jessica:	That’s funny. She needs fixed or you’re going to have kittens
	8:11 PM	Jessica:	That would be even funnier
	9:46 PM	Jason:	Did hunter say if he was coming back here?
	9:46 PM	Jessica:	No here is my understanding
	9:47 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:47 PM	Jason:	Backpack still here
	9:47 PM	Jessica:	Ugh...
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	Just messaged him
	9:51 PM	Jessica:	Dropping him off in the morning to get it and so he can bike
	9:51 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:51 PM	Jason:	Bringing his bike then?
	9:52 PM	Jessica:	His biked is there
	9:52 PM	Jessica:	Bike
	9:52 PM	Jason:	... no
	9:56 PM	Jessica:	Clarification. He has it, is biking to your place because it won’t fit in Geatans car, he will get his backpack and get dropped here
	9:57 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:57 PM	Jason:	Just didn’t want either us to have late night/early morning surprise 🙂
	9:58 PM	Jessica:	Agreed. I called him, reminded him to plan better with what is where. Clothes he wants are here. That it does not mean extra driving or even earlier morning for us
	10:00 PM	Jessica:	Brenna biking both ways tomorrow. I’ll get her right after work. She’s bringing violin 😬
	10:04 PM	Jason:	Woo. First use of those caribiners. Hope it works and she plays beautifully.
	10:05 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully....

Thursday, September 6, 2018

	7:31 AM	Jessica:	Hunter started there, please make sure he’s not in bed. Supposedly was going in early to discuss Saturday school. No need for Brenna’s bike. Dana taking her and picking her up.
	7:42 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:42 AM	Jason:	Hunter was up. Heard him in bathroom same time I showered.
	7:43 AM	Jason:	Actually, I should still check he didn’t go back to bed ...
	7:44 AM	Jason:	Yep, he’s gone
	7:44 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	8:30 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:31 AM	Jason:	Awesome, thanks. I feel like you should get that in your account. I’ll tx when it arrives.
	8:34 AM	Jessica:	It looks like I’m definitely going to bonus for September. I’ll keep you posted closer to the end of the month. That will be 1760. I would like to keep 1000 out towards attorneys fees and we could use the rest to pay the competition fees
	8:52 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:26 PM	Jason:	more convinced each day that quinoa isn’t a food that should be eaten from a jar while standing
	12:59 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, that’s asking for trouble
	12:59 PM	Jessica:	In your keyboard?
	1:00 PM	Jason:	I have to wipe off my keyboard about two times per lunch
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	and dry air probably 😂
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	compressed air..ugh
	1:03 PM	Jason:	yeah, it’s shameful
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	From Sgt Parker regarding Monday details:
	1:04 PM	Jessica:	Details for Monday:
Get there at 5:40, I give his a little brief on what to expect from the Doctors and everyone up there.
From there he will be going through the process until about 10:00. From there he or I will call you and tell you that you can head down to see him swear in and sign his contract. Most likely the swear in will happen between 11-12. If the system is down or if there is a lot of people then it might take longer but we will play that by ear.
	1:04 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	Zach collected on lunch today. I lost a bet at the wedding damn it
	1:28 PM	Jason:	what was your bet?
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	that he would get teary eyed when he saw her in her dress. The argument they had was that a tear didn’t actually fall...so I owe him two lunches
	1:32 PM	Jason:	phbbt
	2:28 PM	Jason:	mojito kombucha
	2:29 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	ummm....yuck
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	stick with the mojito, skip the Kombucha
	2:32 PM	Jason:	i think you’re probably right
	2:32 PM	Jason:	smells like a urinal
	2:33 PM	Jason:	of course i’m still drinking it
	2:35 PM	Jessica:	I’m having hot chocolate...it sounded good. Definitely better than your pee drink😬
	2:52 PM	Jason:	fine fine
	2:58 PM	Jessica:	speaking of pee
	2:58 PM	Jessica:	Brenna wet my bed last night 😟
	2:59 PM	Jason:	oh no. poor you two
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	yeah, no longer new mattress. late night
	3:01 PM	Jason:	ugh
	6:24 PM	Jason:	Not a problem but wondering if hunter means to have a plan about being here or there. I thought he would be there so haven’t shopped or anything.
	6:24 PM	Jason:	Him and buddy here working on their bikes, so that’s kinda cool
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	Isn’t he working?
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	He hasn’t mentioned anything to me. I know most of his clothes are here.
	6:32 PM	Jessica:	Though he likes to hang with friends after for a bit so easier to get them to give him a ride there
	6:33 PM	Jessica:	I think he just used whichever house is most convenient to sleep at
	6:33 PM	Jessica:	Uses
	6:36 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	6:36 PM	Jason:	He said he traded nights with someone
	6:36 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	6:37 PM	Jason:	Was just curious. Like seeing him being industrious
	6:39 PM	Jessica:	Agreed. Still not sold on the work thing. His bike tool thing is here. Brenna and I found it in my bed
	6:39 PM	Jason:	Weird place
	6:40 PM	Jason:	Was trying to help them but don’t seem interested in old man ideas
	6:40 PM	Jason:	Like using grease
	6:41 PM	Jessica:	You’re just an old man who knows nothing about bikes😂
	6:42 PM	Jason:	yeah. i let them be.
	6:42 PM	Jason:	that we’d have bike bonding but it’s maybe it’s new buddy bonding time and i’m a third wheel
	6:42 PM	Jason:	*thought
	6:43 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, I think we’re past bonding time for awhile. All about friends
	6:43 PM	Jason:	We had a fairly nice time fixing his initial bike build mess-ups :)
	6:44 PM	Jessica:	Brenna rearranging her room... For the 100th time
	6:44 PM	Jason:	of course
	6:46 PM	Jason:	jeez. don’t even want me to order them pizza.
	6:46 PM	Jason:	i guess it’s just my party
	6:46 PM	Jason:	and i’ll cry if i want to
	6:49 PM	Jessica:	Okay... Now I’m shocked
	9:31 PM	Jessica:	Hunter biking here. I refused to get him. I told him to plan earlier. He’s been off school since 1. Dana got Brenna after school and could have gotten him or dropped clothes I was off at 5 and could have. Not stopping in middle of movie now.
	9:32 PM	Jason:	Seems fair. Not enough clean clothes here? Too hard to run wash?
	9:33 PM	Jessica:	I know most new ones here. No clue. His issue to figure out
	9:33 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Friday, September 7, 2018

	8:19 AM	Jessica:	Deborah picking taking today (thank god)  reminder to pick up. I’ll drop Brenna’s stuff after work
	8:46 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:24 AM	Jason:	Okay if Hunter at your place Saturday night? Brenna wants to camp.
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	Yep.
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	She was grouchy about gymnastics today, had been working on me to skip. I said no.
	10:27 AM	Jason:	typical
	10:30 AM	Jessica:	Hunter should probably stay Sunday to since he has to be dressed nicely and at MEPS off of Fort street at 5:40 am
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	too
	12:32 PM	Jason:	Probably camp along N. Fork Boise River, get there on some trails then come back via Rabbit Creek Road and Idaho City https://www.gaiagps.com/datasummary/route/c80ed140-7a1b-4b32-b08e-f43d32a7c483/
	12:33 PM	Jason:	That map is the trail part
	12:46 PM	Jason:	Obviously we can’t go until phone is set or I’m sure Brenna will go nuts
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	I actually just grabbed her phone at lunch. Went to grab her stuff that she wanted dropped like scratchy etc and it’s gone so I think she already packed it, but noticed phone there. It’s in the glove box of the Jeep
	1:05 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	I’m here till 5 if you want to grab it
	1:18 PM	Jason:	oh, okay. Jeep is on the open lot, unlocked?
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	yep
	1:19 PM	Jason:	I’ll grab it then
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:37 PM	Jason:	Do you happen to know her pin? I could activate it tonight if I could open it.
	1:38 PM	Jessica:	I don’t 😬
	3:24 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	Oh sure, rub it in that I’m still at work!
	3:25 PM	Jason:	New cider place
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	Wait, after all three empty ones yours? That will be good biking
	3:26 PM	Jason:	Drove car to grocery shop on way home
	3:26 PM	Jason:	And brought extra monitors to work
	3:28 PM	Jessica:	Their gin one of good. Think I brought back some before for you

Saturday, September 8, 2018

	11:13 AM	Jason:	Brenna phone active.
	11:14 AM	Jason:	If you happen to be out and about, maybe you can grab Hunter. Or I’ll drop him before Brenna and I ride.
	11:14 AM	Jason:	He says his bike is already at your place.
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Yay, bet she’s excited.
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	When are you guys leaving so I know when to get him by?
	11:15 AM	Jason:	probably about 1/1:30
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Will grab him and find scratchy
	11:15 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:10 PM	Jason:	Hunter is definitely being monitored by neighbors. :) Posted in Southshore group that Brenna and I will be gone and both Patti and Christine replied to tell me about Hunter, yesterday and today.
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	Oh good
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	I think
	1:11 PM	Jason:	Yeah, nothing negative
	1:12 PM	Jason:	Hunter and “group” of teens were here at 3:30 
AM, apparently
	1:12 PM	Jason:	None were here this morning so I guess they were just getting something?
	1:12 PM	Jessica:	Yes that I knew. He called to ask if Riley could stay but I was asleep.
	1:15 PM	Jessica:	He told me when I pulled in. They slept in the truck bed. He said he put the blankets away
	1:17 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:19 PM	Jason:	and we’re off ...
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Be careful!
	1:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	1:21 PM	Jessica:	Funny....🤨
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	Yep, Hunter has been lying. Not at work, got fired

Sunday, September 9, 2018

	11:34 AM	Jason:	Oh crap
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, he’s on lockdown here until signing tomorrow. Still has ton of missing assignments. Turned off his phone
	11:37 AM	Jason:	We’re out of the mountains
	11:37 AM	Jason:	Watched helicopter scoop water like 20 feet from us
	11:37 AM	Jessica:	I guessed, Brenna just messaged
	11:38 AM	Jason:	Ah
	11:38 AM	Jason:	In Idaho city
	11:38 AM	Jessica:	Bet Brenna thought that was cool
	11:38 AM	Jason:	How did hunter get fired?
	11:39 AM	Jason:	I should say why
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	Probably for calling in shifts, like DQ
	11:39 AM	Jason:	Yeah
	11:41 AM	Jessica:	I was suspicious Tuesday when I was there and messaged him and he didn’t come out to say hi. Turn her told me he was at work Friday when I checked his phone he was at the mall. Told me yesterday he was going and cornered him and he kind of fessed up
	11:42 AM	Jason:	So many lies
	11:43 AM	Jason:	Bike and lights were for that commute
	11:43 AM	Jason:	I was asking him when he’d get promoted and getting a whole story about it
	11:44 AM	Jessica:	Oh yeah...he was totally spinning a story yesterday until I called bs
	11:45 AM	Jessica:	Saying he’s getting a job at eggman because he’ll get tips. I think no job. He gets paid for drill, needs to focus on school
	11:46 AM	Jason:	Supposed to pay you for phone and me a tiny bit for bike accessories
	11:46 AM	Jason:	Drill should cover
	11:46 AM	Jason:	Where is it at?
	11:47 AM	Jason:	Gowan?
	11:48 AM	Jessica:	Think so
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	For tomorrow:
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	550 W Fort St Boise ID 83702
	7:30 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Do you know what time for actual induction
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	He calls at 10 with the time. Supposed to be between 11-12. I think Terry going too
	7:32 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	I’m not looking forward to being up that early but looking forward to him signing!!
	7:33 PM	Jason:	Long road
	7:34 PM	Jessica:	He’s going to be the death of me.

Monday, September 10, 2018

	9:02 AM	Jessica:	Srgnt Parker said this morning the last couple signing ceremonies were at 12:30. Ill keep you posted once he texts me
	9:02 AM	Jason:	Thanks
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	There is not enough coffee in the world this morning!
	9:11 AM	Jason:	Ugh. Time for espresso.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	Seriously may need to. Brutal 5am wake up, then spent the last hour literally running in heels to hotels to deliver wireless keyboards to the idiots who didn’t plan well.
	9:13 AM	Jason:	that sounds terrible
	9:14 AM	Jessica:	not a good way to start the week 😂
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	Hunter was disqualified because of his hearing, he can’t enlist
	11:22 AM	Jason:	Oh crap
	11:22 AM	Jason:	Not in any branch?
	11:22 AM	Jason:	Can’t get a hearing aid or something?
	11:22 AM	Jessica:	one sec, having a bit of a breakdown
	11:23 AM	Jason:	:(
	11:25 AM	Jessica:	just asked, waiting for response, don’t think so
	11:27 AM	Jessica:	might be able to for air force he said, they can run waivers that they can’t
	11:29 AM	Jason:	you at their office?
	11:29 AM	Jessica:	mine, Srgt brought him home
	11:29 AM	Jason:	hmm, guess now i think of it, assumed national guard would be most flexible
	11:39 AM	Jessica:	my friend Stephanie here, her husband Terry is Air Force, higher level. She’s seeing what we can find out and have him pull the records. If a way around it have him meet with them. Though he’s saying he doesn’t want air force because they don’t have anything he likes....
	11:40 AM	Jason:	maybe he’ll come around to the idea
	11:41 AM	Jessica:	hoping if we get him sat down with somebody that can show him what’s available. it actually is a but cushier branch I’m being told. I seriously feel sick right now
	11:42 AM	Jason:	i know. a lot hinged on this idea.
	1:16 PM	Jessica:	Just had lunch with Terry, he’s going to reach out to Hunter, be better at spending some more time helping direct/focus him. Encourage the airforce path if available
	1:18 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:19 PM	Jason:	And I guess we’ll have to be more serious (if that’s possible) about him staying on top of homework
	1:19 PM	Jason:	Maybe regrets getting fired now
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, I told him this weekend if there are missing assignments he goes nowhere. School or house. Hard to enforce for a bit since he’s done at 1:15 so has a huge window until either of us available to enforce/check . Frustrated because not sure what to do on his meds until I get air force info. If it’s not a possibility then he needs to be on them, if is needs to stay off
	1:22 PM	Jason:	Right
	1:23 PM	Jason:	I can disable Netflix in hours after school. Have before. Not sure it helps, though. Just always find him, blanket and food on couch.
	1:24 PM	Jason:	Phone staying offa while?
	1:25 PM	Jason:	I’ll work with him on homework tonight
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	one sec, on a call for a bit
	1:25 PM	Jason:	Assuming at house
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	he’s at mine
	1:27 PM	Jason:	For this week? Or a while
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	I think he wanted to be there after. I will touch base to see if he wants me to bring him over to be there for school or stay with me and I bring him tomorrow.
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	yes, phone off until no missing assignments
	1:53 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:56 PM	Jessica:	We’ll have to figure out how to thwart him on the internet thing.
	5:00 PM	Jason:	Could you bring Brenna’s bike helmet if you come?
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	6:17 PM	Jessica:	Dropping in the morning when I take Hunter to school
	6:18 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:23 PM	Jessica:	Can you look at his missing assignments and tell me which ones you guys did so I know which ones he needs to work on. Assuming anything that was due this week and now shows missing needs done
	6:25 PM	Jason:	looking
	6:26 PM	Jason:	Of those, the only one he did that I saw was the teacher interview questions, which he sort of scribbled out and likely lost. So probably none.
	6:27 PM	Jessica:	Okay
	6:27 PM	Jason:	Oh wait, maybe HW6. Didn’t notice that one in there. Not positive since I didn’t look at the title on each paper we worked on.
	6:28 PM	Jason:	I do know he said he didn’t need to work on HW9 yet since it was yet “missing” --- you know, that’s when you have to start working on a thing
	6:28 PM	Jason:	*wasn’t yet
	6:28 PM	Jessica:	Of course
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Brenna used all our data in one day
	6:31 PM	Jason:	Now her phone is set up to be disabled when it gets near limit
	6:33 PM	Jessica:	Oh geez, she beat Hunter doing the same
	6:33 PM	Jason:	Does iPhone have option to stop using data at some limit?
	6:34 PM	Jessica:	I have data saver on so it can’t go over but need to figure out if I can set his to his phone
	7:56 PM	Jessica:	He’s working on math now, Dana picking him up right after school
	7:58 PM	Jessica:	I don’t think he totally understood the disqualified thing. He asked when we would find out if they can do a waiver for the army.
	7:59 PM	Jason:	Even the air force is a long shot in regards to a waiver, from what you said?
	7:59 PM	Jason:	Dana picking him up tomorrow, you mean?
	8:02 PM	Jessica:	Not sure it’s a long shot. They have more leeway but until they pull over his test no clue. Yes, Dana picking up. He’s going to help with some yard work and I can be on him about school. Trying to keep him from lounging there while your gone or taking off with friends if possible. We went to dinner, I think he’s more upset than letting on. Is being more open to air force option if possible
	8:04 PM	Jason:	It has to be a blow. It’s kind of been his plan in some form or another for a long time.
	8:14 PM	Jessica:	Yeah. Also it’s my fault he quit working 😂
	9:27 PM	Jason:	Oh really. I’m curious to know the logic of that.
	9:44 PM	Jessica:	I didn’t help him get the truck he wanted to make payments on so no motivation to work
	9:45 PM	Jessica:	Shut down that pretty fast
	9:50 PM	Jason:	woah. yeah, like dishwashing job is good for $35k truck. reality, meet hunter; hunter, meet reality :)
	9:52 PM	Jessica:	Oh... So much reality conversation tonight. I let him know he proved EXACTLY why I made the right choice. Action on his part versus all his talk and spinning
	9:56 PM	Jason:	I hope he took some of that to heart (same hope we’ve always had). If he’s not eligible for any military, hard to see how he doesn’t end up living in the Thomas commune.
	9:57 PM	Jason:	If he doesn’t find some motivation within himself soon.
	9:57 PM	Jessica:	You just voiced my worst dear
	9:57 PM	Jason:	*fear
	9:57 PM	Jessica:	Fear
	9:57 PM	Jessica:	Zip it
	9:58 PM	Jason:	Frankly, after he’s 18 and done with school, I can’t see having him crash here if he’s not willing to keep even the simplest, most convenient (within a few blocks) jobs
	10:01 PM	Jessica:	I absolutely agree. Have made that clear. I think the one motivation (if possible) is he doesn’t want to be there. I worry about trying to run with friends etc. He won’t even talk to Scott. Hasn’t in months. Scott finally asked last week if he had a new phone# talked to me today about his avoidance. Not a fun conversation
	10:02 PM	Jason:	I wish Hunter really understood how eager we are to help him, how excited we would be to pitch in if we saw even a bit of sustained effort.
	10:04 PM	Jessica:	I did remind him of that. We would love to help him with a car, phone, freedom, future etc. If only he would quit lying, keep his grades up... Simple stuff
	10:05 PM	Jessica:	But every conversation is...I want, can you get me.. Stupid requests with nothing to stand on
	10:06 PM	Jason:	I know. The word that comes to mind is the one said often of Trump: “transactional." What can I get?
	10:06 PM	Jason:	Little sense of the underlying factors.
	10:06 PM	Jason:	Or maybe just little interest in those factors.
	10:07 PM	Jessica:	He wanted to go to a movie tonight, get his ears pierced....I was like you’re kidding right?
	10:07 PM	Jessica:	Agreed.
	10:07 PM	Jessica:	I seriously don’t know what to do if can’t get a waiver for air force
	10:10 PM	Jason:	I think we’ve pulled every lever we could find. At this point, it seems we can only let Hunter know, as you have, that we’re always here to help him help himself (as it were). And we have to have some kind of peace that we made the best feasible choices for him.
	10:11 PM	Jason:	Sure, he and others can imagine magic wand choices but we never had a magic wand.
	10:11 PM	Jessica:	I know, still feel sick to my stomach with fear of his future
	10:12 PM	Jessica:	Can only put him in this lock down to a point
	10:13 PM	Jessica:	3 more months... Lose all leverage
	10:15 PM	Jason:	If he ends up on an impoverished path it will be sad to know he was capable of so much more. But I bet he’ll be his happy self if he’s got some buddies around, regardless of other circumstances.
	10:15 PM	Jessica:	Actually had to take a Xanax today. I’ve had it for a month and avoided taking one through all that’s happening. Today...needed it
	10:15 PM	Jason:	Surprised you’re awake then :(
	10:16 PM	Jessica:	Terrified to be put in the position of kicking him out
	10:16 PM	Jason:	Maybe he’ll be stoked about getting his own place
	10:16 PM	Jessica:	It was around 11:30😂
	10:16 PM	Jason:	When that time comes
	10:17 PM	Jessica:	With what job??? At this point as I told him, he won’t be able to even work at McDonald’s
	10:17 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I know. He’ll be left to do what Nick did. Actual work.
	10:18 PM	Jason:	Where the only qualification is, you’re alive and can move things.
	10:18 PM	Jessica:	He’s going to be our one that learns the hard way I fear...
	10:19 PM	Jason:	Seems inevitable that he’ll have some hard lessons ahead. He’s been borrowing against his own future for years now.
	10:19 PM	Jessica:	I can’t even get my hopes up now for air force
	10:19 PM	Jason:	Yeah, you shouldn’t. Or, if you like, prepare for the worst, hope for the best.
	10:21 PM	Jessica:	I still am shocked. We were in a crowded loud restaurant and could talk easily with him hearing me...I just don’t get it. I know he has some hearing loss, but not substantial by any means
	10:21 PM	Jason:	Good point. Occasionally it comes up but never as a disqualifying issue.
	10:22 PM	Jason:	He hears perfectly well when it’s in his interest.
	10:22 PM	Jessica:	They actually waived his hand, he can’t rotate it even halfway because of the surgeries
	10:22 PM	Jessica:	They decided it was borderline
	10:22 PM	Jason:	Oh, I didn’t know he’d lost that much movement. He probably could have been doing some at-home PT if he wanted.
	10:23 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, it is way more substantial I think
	10:23 PM	Jessica:	Now I’m just venting
	10:24 PM	Jason:	Best to get it out before you’re trying to sleep
	10:25 PM	Jessica:	Trying not to cry or let him see how disappointed I am. Don’t want him to take it personal. Just so worried
	10:27 PM	Jason:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFcYuIB0SVw
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Ass
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	That didn’t help me not cry
	10:35 PM	Jason:	If all his assignments could culminate in some kind of fair and presentation ...
	10:35 PM	Jessica:	If only!
	10:36 PM	Jason:	He’d do great
	10:38 PM	Jessica:	Kiss Brenna for me, she called and I called back but she was busy talking to Delaney... So it begins
	10:38 PM	Jason:	Will do
	10:40 PM	Jessica:	Will keep you posted on the many people checking out the air force option. Not getting my hopes up though
	10:40 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:42 PM	Jason:	Maybe hunter will find motivation if he realizes he’s out of options
	10:43 PM	Jessica:	God I hope so. I’m so lost at this point

Tuesday, September 11, 2018

	11:12 AM	Jason:	I wonder if we should try to get Hunter thinking of post-high school ed. Maybe a trade school would hold his interest ... I’ve been looking up a few.
	11:12 AM	Jason:	I have no illusion that he could manage himself in regular college.
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	I agree, regular college will never work. The only way I thought CWI might was because he would be in ROTC and enlisted. I think trade school may be an option, if it’s a trade he’s interested in
	11:24 AM	Jason:	He seems to like working on things, like his bike with his buddy. Maybe. I’ll research as much as I can.
	11:25 AM	Jessica:	Thanks, options are needed at this point 😵
	12:03 PM	Jason:	The $225 flex deposit hit. Feel free to pull it over to your acct.
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	Thanks, I’ll just leave it since I haven’t moved over the child support that I used of 188
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	weird that they broke it into two pieces/deposits. Almost missed it
	7:34 PM	Jessica:	I’m going to be bringing Hunter over shortly
	7:34 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Wednesday, September 12, 2018

	8:35 AM	Jessica:	I’m betting Brenna did not want to bike today...because it is COLD!
	8:35 AM	Jason:	She’s been declining to bike. She’s stubborn.
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	it was pretty cold this morning, shocked me when I went out
	8:37 AM	Jason:	Yeah, leaves will soon be falling
	8:37 AM	Jason:	I had to pedal harder to warm up
	8:37 AM	Jessica:	yeah, you’ll get to play in snow soon enough
	8:37 AM	Jessica:	I’m delegating
	8:37 AM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	8:37 AM	Jason:	it’s about time
	8:38 AM	Jessica:	haha, careful what you say, I’m delegating to you!
	8:38 AM	Jason:	oh damn
	8:38 AM	Jessica:	you’re more eloquent than me, you’re in charge of writing assignments
	8:39 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent an attachment.
	8:39 AM	Jessica:	it’s trying to load, my internet is REALLY bad now. I was down most of yesterday
	8:39 AM	Jason:	oh yea
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	8:40 AM	Jason:	I’ll get right on that
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	thanks :)
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	New computer..WOOOHOOOO!!! that is all
	10:45 AM	Jason:	finally
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	exactly
	7:09 PM	Jason:	Not sure where Hunter is. Bike is home. Brenna wanted to climb more at JUMP. Went to invite Hunter but not in room.
	7:18 PM	Jessica:	Damn it
	7:18 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:18 PM	Jason:	Pre-jumping
	7:21 PM	Jessica:	Wait, why not at gymnastics?
	7:21 PM	Jason:	Deborah had to cancel driving because piper had something
	7:22 PM	Jason:	I already left work early yesterday
	7:22 PM	Jessica:	This is getting ridiculous. She’s missing so much because of cancellation/missed pick ups
	7:23 PM	Jason:	Hard to help
	7:28 PM	Jessica:	I’ll talk to Jessie and see if he has any ideas. I did put in a call about the van possibility, hadn’t heard anything. Maybe if he looks into it
	7:28 PM	Jason:	Yeah, thanks, can’t be first ones with this challenge
	7:39 PM	Jessica:	I left a message with Tanner to have Hunter get back ASAP and if not with him to snap chat him that. I don’t know how else to message him without turning his phone on. When he does show please take his phone
	7:54 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:54 PM	Jason:	I won
	7:55 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure she’s thrilled
	7:59 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:00 PM	Jason:	Won again
	8:00 PM	Jessica:	This is going to get ugly 😂
	8:02 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:02 PM	Jason:	Three time loser
	8:02 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, but can you do that?
	8:03 PM	Jason:	Good point
	8:16 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:16 PM	Jason:	Just rewards
	8:16 PM	Jessica:	You just wanted ice cream
	8:17 PM	Jason:	We’re on Brenna’s evening itinerary
	8:19 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:20 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	8:31 PM	Jason:	No hunter here
	8:31 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:31 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:33 PM	Jason:	Never mind
	8:33 PM	Jason:	In bathroom with all lights out
	8:38 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, he just called from Brenna’s phone... You won’t believe his request or excuse
	8:38 PM	Jason:	Yeah? I haven’t heard it yet.
	8:39 PM	Jessica:	He wanted me to turn in his phone so he could call summer to get help with tutoring. He says he started at school and got help from teacher’s and helped with back to school night 😂
	8:40 PM	Jessica:	Stayed
	8:43 PM	Jessica:	I told him bs, still didn’t have permission. Turn in phone and until we see actual action and improvement he has no freedoms. If he really needs to message her you can help him with that
	8:44 PM	Jason:	Sad thing we have to take for granted that everything he says is untrue. But he keeps proving it. :(
	8:45 PM	Jessica:	I pretty much said that exact thing. Until he quits talking and starts doing....
	8:46 PM	Jessica:	Didn’t know Brenna got stung or lost a tooth
	8:50 PM	Jason:	Not sure it was a real sting. She barely mentioned it. And she barely mentioned the tooth to me too.
	8:51 PM	Jason:	LIke an oh-by-the-way while getting out of car for gymnastics
	8:53 PM	Jessica:	Hahaha, of course. I heard a more dramatic version and pics
	8:54 PM	Jessica:	She’s saying she has a headache now. Told her a bath and some water to combat exercise and sugar
	8:55 PM	Jason:	That’s funny since I told her ice cream should cure
	8:55 PM	Jason:	Gave her some ibuprofen
	8:56 PM	Jessica:	Of course you did

Thursday, September 13, 2018

	9:27 AM	Jason:	Home with Brenna who said her stomach was sick, though all I’ve heard is singing
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	complaining of any more headaches?
	9:28 AM	Jason:	no, said stomach
	9:30 AM	Jessica:	I copied you on emails to Hunter’s school councelor
	9:30 AM	Jason:	Yeah, saw those. I guess I’ll be here to ask about study hall if he shows up shortly after 1:00.
	9:32 AM	Jessica:	Just trying to give some structure/help to those couple of hours rather than taking off with friends or watching tv. Not sure what the hell to do anymore
	9:36 AM	Jessica:	did you call reiverside?
	9:37 AM	Jason:	ah, no. i’ll do that.
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:40 AM	Jason:	done
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	thanks, before they call me 😂
	9:41 AM	Jason:	Almost a bummer he withdrew from those hours now ...
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	yeah, don’t want him in classes with more work though. Not sure whether to make it optional or mandatory for him to be in library for 6th and Algebra 2 seminar 7th
	9:44 AM	Jason:	what’s the argument for optional?
	9:46 AM	Jessica:	don’t really have one other than him fighting it
	9:47 AM	Jason:	i’d say mandatory. easier for everyone, including him in the longer run. he’s really the last person that should be having an abbreviated school day.
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	agreed
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	Kayla had a severe allergic reaction to tuna :(
	10:09 AM	Jason:	oh no!
	10:09 AM	Jason:	is she getting a battery of tests so she can know, like you, what to avoid?
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	funny thing is she just did them but the tests were all for grasses/pollens/animals etc. Not food and she was just there yesterday. She plans on making an appt. For now keeping benadryl on her and avoiding tuna.
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Her words: I went to lunch with a friend from work and had a big piece of tuna and when we got back to the office my heart started beating out of my chest and I broke out in like a red rash all over and was super hot and couldn’t breath
They were going to call an ambulance but I took some pills and it went away in like 10 minutes
	10:12 AM	Jason:	You know how scary that is
	10:12 AM	Jason:	crazy
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I want her to get tested to see if she should have an epi pen in case or if it was just some type of bacterial reaction
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	she has surgery on her eye Sunday
	10:13 AM	Jason:	what? for what?
	10:14 AM	Jessica:	that sty on her eyelid that never fully went away, didn’t you notice it?
	10:15 AM	Jason:	yeah. didn’t know surgery was planned. that sounds like a relatively simple procedure (hopefully)
	10:15 AM	Jessica:	yeah, just fluid or something stuck in there, nothing making it go away...but still EYE 😱
	10:16 AM	Jason:	expecting quick recovery?
	10:16 AM	Jessica:	pretty sure
	1:12 PM	Jason:	I’m sure you saw this https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/wine-tasting-can-work-brain-more-math-according-neuroscience-ncna907131
	1:29 PM	Jason:	Hunter’s home. I mentioned we were signing him up for classes.
	1:49 PM	Jessica:	I didn’t see that but I like it!
	1:49 PM	Jessica:	and his reaction? probably none
	1:49 PM	Jason:	yeah, not much. he said you said he could join lacrosse so he’s focused on that
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	nope that’s not what I said. obviously he can’t with his grades anyway.
	1:51 PM	Jason:	well, he believes he is. you know how it is. focus on everything but what requires it.
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	yeah, well maybe it will motivate him to get his grades up (that was sarcasm). I am fine with him playing a sport...if he has passing grades..as always. Not sure how he even makes the team in his senior year with never playing
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	well jeez...wine TASTING, that’s a different ball game
	1:57 PM	Jason:	I wonder if any of these would interest Hunter http://cwidaho.cc/programs-degrees/career-technical-education
	1:57 PM	Jason:	Would be more obvious if they had a lounging certification
	2:15 PM	Jessica:	did he hand over his phone yesterday?
	2:16 PM	Jason:	he didn’t. he avoided me.
	2:19 PM	Jessica:	16 missing assignments
	2:20 PM	Jason:	that’s crazy. what is he doing during class?
	2:20 PM	Jessica:	not work obviously
	2:21 PM	Jessica:	He’s had an hour, when you feel motivated tell him I want him at the counter working on stuff and his phone handed over.
	2:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:21 PM	Jason:	i will. he’s still at school (theoretically) signing up for lacrosse
	2:25 PM	Jessica:	during classes, doubtful. yeah, no grades no play
	2:25 PM	Jason:	what’s the plan if he fails classes this semester? he can’t graduate then, can he?
	2:26 PM	Jessica:	I don’t think so
	2:27 PM	Jessica:	GED?
	2:27 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I guess that’s inevitable. My first thought, though, is no point in attending next semester. Or is there?
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	Will have to talk to Lisa and see what options are possible
	2:28 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:57 PM	Jessica:	she going to gymnastics?
	3:58 PM	Jason:	oh, i didn’t think of that since she doesn’t usually go today
	3:58 PM	Jessica:	oh jeez, I had it in my mind it was a gym day
	3:58 PM	Jason:	:)
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	Hunter show?
	4:04 PM	Jason:	Nope
	4:08 PM	Jessica:	I would say if he says he’s “going to the school” for anything the answer is no. That’s what he pulled yesterday
	4:09 PM	Jason:	Agree. I let myself be fooled by the lad “mom said okay”
	4:09 PM	Jason:	*old
	4:10 PM	Jessica:	I can’t even find lacrosse on the timberline athletic site, not a fall spot usually. Wonder if new this year..but still isn’t usually in the fall, it’s a spring sport
	4:10 PM	Jason:	I’m sure you still told him he could play 🙂
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure....
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	I won’t even have to tell him no with his current grades, they will
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	He show up?
	7:23 PM	Jason:	Yep. Working on algebra now.
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Thank you
	7:24 PM	Jason:	Brenna mad since we were going to park but we’ll all go to blue cow or something instead. I’m sure it will be fine. :)
	7:24 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, she got to stay home and play last night.
	8:41 PM	Jason:	Blue Cow complete. Algebra resumed.
	8:42 PM	Jessica:	Sugar needed😂
	8:46 PM	Jason:	I’m just barely hearing a phone call happening ...
	8:54 PM	Jessica:	Yep, kids called
	8:55 PM	Jessica:	He wants to get his hair cut tomorrow and get some poster board and flowers to ask a girl to homecoming Saturday
	8:56 PM	Jason:	oh yeah, he was saying that when we walked to Blue Cow
	8:57 PM	Jason:	he has school that day too, right?
	8:59 PM	Jason:	yeah, verified e-mail, 8am - 11am
	9:00 PM	Jessica:	Yep😁
	9:00 PM	Jessica:	Reminded him of new school schedule tomorrow.
	9:02 PM	Jason:	Yeah, me too. He seems thrilled.
	9:05 PM	Jessica:	Was that sarcasm? He wasn’t grouchy with me about it so took it as a good sign
	9:16 PM	Jason:	Sarcasm yes but didn’t seem upset
	9:27 PM	Jessica:	Well, small win I guess

Friday, September 14, 2018

	9:08 AM	Jessica:	Am I picking up girls tonight?
	9:10 AM	Jason:	Right now I’m slated to bring them to gym and andrew pick up. I hope that switches, though, since I already left work early once this week It depends on if he gets back into town soon enough..
	9:14 AM	Jessica:	okay, keep me posted. I can probably take today if needed. Most everybody out of the office at PNLS so can most likely get away with it.
	9:21 AM	Jason:	oh, that would be helpful
	9:21 AM	Jason:	i’ll let you know 3ish if i haven’t heard sooner
	9:21 AM	Jessica:	sounds good
	11:05 AM	Jason:	chili friday
	11:05 AM	Jason:	also chilly friday
	11:06 AM	Jessica:	True on both! Had to wear a jacket this morning, though will be 80 later. Layering :)
	11:14 AM	Jason:	I suppose it makes sense for Hunter to stay tonight so he can get to school at 8am. I can set an alarm to be sure he’s up.
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	that’s very true. I would love to not have to drive him over there.
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	you can help him with his poster :)
	11:15 AM	Jason:	Hooray
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	Well, then it may actually be spelled correctly and look decent.....
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	got my chili!
	1:26 PM	Jason:	well done
	1:26 PM	Jason:	team lunch here. too much pizza.
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	I don’t remember the last time I had pizza
	2:05 PM	Jessica:	I’m going to email Lisa. As much as I hate to give Hunter any leeway I want him to graduate. I see assignments got turned in but marked down because of being late, he get’s 50% for not even doing it. As part of his 504 he gets 2 weeks after due dates and can’t be penalized.
	2:11 PM	Jason:	Agreed
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	copied you
	2:14 PM	Jason:	Think I should encourage him to take meds for tomorrow? You may remember I squirreled away a prescription that he wasn’t using.
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	I’m worries until we know if the airforce is a go. It can’t show up in his bloodwork
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	worried
	2:17 PM	Jason:	Ah, good point. Will leave my drug stash alone for now.
	2:18 PM	Jessica:	was hoping to hear something by now, I know it’s moving through a chain of people.
	2:23 PM	Jason:	haven’t heard from andrew so perhaps brace for driving if you’re still amenable
	2:23 PM	Jessica:	okay
	2:24 PM	Jason:	nevermind, got call immediately after writing
	2:24 PM	Jason:	andrew will take them there
	2:25 PM	Jason:	i’ll message Brenna so she knows
	2:25 PM	Jessica:	oh good, I’ll plan on picking up then
	2:25 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:53 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:53 PM	Jason:	Secret beer
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	jealous, not about beer though
	4:24 PM	Jessica:	Hunter to be at the house by 5:30
	4:45 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:45 PM	Jason:	Just got here
	6:05 PM	Jason:	No Hunter yet ...
	6:05 PM	Jason:	actually, i should check he didn’t sneak in the back ...
	6:05 PM	Jason:	nope
	6:07 PM	Jessica:	He’s fb arguing with me as we speak
	6:13 PM	Jason:	didn’t have phone on me, just a sec
	6:14 PM	Jason:	phone in hand
	6:55 PM	Jason:	got hunter’s phone
	6:55 PM	Jason:	let him know that help with dance prep depends on productive saturday school
	7:01 PM	Jessica:	Thank you
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	Brenna ditched me 😥
	8:59 PM	Jason:	Ah, spending night with someone?
	9:00 PM	Jessica:	Piper, and I think we have a phone problem already. Heard about the texting and Cash liking her🤨
	9:01 PM	Jason:	Oh yeah
	9:01 PM	Jason:	They’re always entertaining passengers
	9:02 PM	Jason:	Well, I’m watching dateline and eating salad if you’re bored
	9:02 PM	Jessica:	That’s quite a Friday night 😂
	9:03 PM	Jason:	Forgot to mention ... lit candle too
	9:04 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	Ambience
	9:05 PM	Jason:	For the cat
	9:07 PM	Jessica:	Of course. I’m sure she appreciates it 😂

Saturday, September 15, 2018

	7:40 AM	Jason:	Hunter up and on his way
	8:13 AM	Jessica:	Thanks
	11:14 AM	Jessica:	Emissions/registration done
	11:14 AM	Jason:	Wow. Drivers license AND legal vehicle. How does it feel?
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	11:32 AM	Jason:	Hunter is back. Half surprised.
	12:00 PM	Jessica:	I’m shocked actually
	12:03 PM	Jason:	He seems iffy about the poster thing. Not sure what transpired.
	12:03 PM	Jason:	I’ll take him to breakfast, see what’s in his head.
	12:04 PM	Jessica:	Okay, let me know if he needs picked up or can ahead be dropped. Just home after errands and dropping Piper’s bday present
	12:05 PM	Jason:	I guess if we drive to IHOP makes sense to drop him afterwards. Whatever works best.
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	Sounds good
	12:06 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:10 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:10 PM	Jason:	We’ve decided he’s going to into law enforcement
	1:14 PM	Jessica:	Concerns there, I looked at it, highly competitive, studying still going to be huge. Would love that option, but he better get waaaay more motivated
	1:14 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	1:23 PM	Jason:	On our way
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:36 PM	Jason:	He has phone from listening to music this morning
	1:37 PM	Jason:	Told him twice he’d be handing it over
	1:48 PM	Jason:	I also reminded him he has math assignments there and that I’d be happy to help with any of it
	1:59 PM	Jessica:	Okay, thanks.

Sunday, September 16, 2018

	10:21 PM	Jessica:	Can you bring scratchy tomorrow?
	10:21 PM	Jason:	Sure
	10:22 PM	Jessica:	Oh course we just remembered right now
	10:25 PM	Jason:	I sent her a picture of it
	10:26 PM	Jessica:	That’s cruel

Monday, September 17, 2018

	8:21 AM	Jessica:	Hunter will go from school to your house for just a bit until Dana picks him up after getting Brenna
	8:33 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:33 AM	Jason:	I didn’t realize Brenna had biked Friday since she hadn’t any other days. Will grab her bike tonight.
	8:34 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:35 AM	Jason:	I’ll bring scratchy to the Jeep sometime
	8:35 AM	Jessica:	How has she been going to school on the days she is there?
	8:35 AM	Jessica:	sure you will, you’re totally using it. I’m telling on you
	8:35 AM	Jason:	she was walking. her preference.
	8:36 AM	Jason:	i knew she’d wear down, though
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	huh, that’s odd
	8:37 AM	Jessica:	I tried to take her to the Hyde Park street fair yesterday, we drove by, she decided it was to crowded
	8:40 AM	Jason:	social anxiety
	8:40 AM	Jason:	*too
	8:40 AM	Jessica:	zip it
	8:50 AM	Jason:	she prefers JUMP when it’s just you and her
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	yeah, she wanted to walk downtown when I offered that as an option. Llama slippers and slime from mixed greens and a weird unicorn thing from record exchange was the damage
	8:56 AM	Jason:	She showed me the slippers. Jealous. After finding my shaving cream empty yesterday and laundry detergent half gone, will probably enforce the ban again.
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	I made the mistake of giving hunter an inch Saturday
	9:03 AM	Jason:	Yeah. Never works. I guess he didn’t need help on any of that math since I didn’t hear from him.
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, pretty sure he focused on the reading since it’s a book he likes that he read years ago
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	reminded him of 7th period today with TWO classes to get it done and library before there is no reason for missing assignments. Did you see the email on his 504?
	9:07 AM	Jason:	Yep. Getting some more credit for that late work should help. Though when I look at his grades, it seems he’s already getting half credit (albeit an F) for work not done.
	9:08 AM	Jason:	I also talked to him about 7th period. Go the same excuse that he didn’t know where it was.
	9:09 AM	Jason:	And got some long story that made no sense about being hit by a car as the reason why he no longer has the bike light I bought him.
	9:10 AM	Jason:	As long as he’s constantly, all day long, making up stories, I wish he’d make them more humorous or dramatic.
	9:15 AM	Jessica:	I hadn’t heard anything about the bike
	9:15 AM	Jason:	Must have been part of the story. He told me he told you about getting “hit by a car."
	9:15 AM	Jason:	Whatever ...
	9:16 AM	Jessica:	or yes, didn’t seem that dramatic from what little he told me
	9:17 AM	Jessica:	Well, I gave him until 12 to go to a later movie Saturday because he had gotten so much done ( yeah, stupid me) was SUPER clear on curfew and this was him needing to prove himself. Got a call at 3am from an officer
	9:18 AM	Jason:	uh oh. what was he up to?
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	complaints about a couple teenagers in cars though a neighborhood supposedly throwing beer cans, being rowdy, possibly hanging out the car naked
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	the other car they didn’t catch. He was with Laney who is 18 so she got sent home, officer brought him for me because I din’t want to drag Brenna out but she was awake since she was sleeping in my bed when I got called. Luckily he wasn’t drinking
	9:22 AM	Jason:	i totally believe they were being rowdy and hanging out of the car naked since that’s exactly the stuff Hunter brags about :)
	9:22 AM	Jason:	not good for law enforcement aspirations, though
	9:23 AM	Jessica:	yeah, not holding my breath on that one
	9:25 AM	Jason:	any consequence for that?
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	Did let him know if he doesn’t have his $#@! together by this semester to be on track to graduate, if this current path continues he will not be staying with either of us. He can live with Scott, we’re done.
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	from the police you mean? no
	9:26 AM	Jason:	I also told him he can’t fail any classes this semester or he won’t be able to graduate and we’re not sure then if there’s any point in keeping him in school. He answer was “summer school."
	9:26 AM	Jason:	He really doesn’t know future-Hunter very well.
	9:27 AM	Jason:	He never realizes that future-Hunter is exactly the same as right-now-Hunter.
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	Obviously I have his phone. He’s being totally babysat. If I’m not there Dana was to make sure he wasn’t watching t.v. also why she is picking him up when she gets Brenna. When he tried to sleep in or keep falling asleep on the couch while reading I woke him up and said tough. I didn’t get sleep, neither does he
	9:27 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:28 AM	Jessica:	summer school 😂
	9:28 AM	Jason:	i know
	9:33 AM	Jessica:	two more weeks until internet/equipment fixed 😡
	9:33 AM	Jason:	that’s crazy
	9:35 AM	Jessica:	a bit better since getting new laptop
	10:40 AM	Jason:	Jeep in the usual place? I’ll bring scratchy.
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	yep
	10:50 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:53 AM	Jason:	Walking through downtown with scratch
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	okay, that is funny
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Just spoke with the executive officer of the army national guard. He is making some calls to see what the medical showed. It may be a matter of being denied because of the MOS position he chose. May be possible to have him change that to be waived in and his foot is then in the door and MOS can change later. Fingers crossed.
	3:13 PM	Jason:	Oh, that would be a relief
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	would be a HUGE relief, scared to get my hopes up though at this point. I’ll end up needing another xanax
	3:17 PM	Jason:	Yeah. Sure seems that would be an obvious thing to have said when he didn’t qualify: just change your occupation.
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	that’s what my concern is
	3:25 PM	Jason:	Sounds like you don’t know what his exact results were ... reading some of the military guidelines ...
	3:28 PM	Jason:	One recruiter saying they had authority to grant waivers to otherwise highly qualified candidates but doesn’t happen often
	3:29 PM	Jason:	I guess we’ll see...
	3:40 PM	Jessica:	just that he was disqualified because of the hearing
	3:42 PM	Jessica:	alos was led to believe from srgnt parker that only airforce had more leeway for waivers....so maddening
	3:43 PM	Jessica:	multi tasking, no typing corrections!
	3:43 PM	Jason:	would really have been nice to have this flagged as an issue sooner, say by youth challenge
	3:43 PM	Jessica:	exactly
	3:43 PM	Jason:	phbbt, i don’t even notice your typos
	5:36 PM	Jason:	Could you check that Brenna is connecting to your WiFi. She’s already used all the data again after just five days.
	5:38 PM	Jason:	I’ve used 0.04GB and she’s used 3GBV
	5:38 PM	Jessica:	I just checked, she had it off
	5:38 PM	Jason:	data off or WiFi off? she keeps turning WiFi off
	5:39 PM	Jessica:	Wifi off. Yeah she turned it off when she wakes the dogs to listen to music and didn’t reconnect. Told her not to do that, just keep on and have done downloaded. Who knows at school
	5:40 PM	Jason:	all her usage was over the weekend
	5:40 PM	Jason:	now she loses a whole month
	5:40 PM	Jason:	she’ll learn
	5:41 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, Hunter 9.94, me .72
	5:42 PM	Jason:	we had 8gb until you changed the plan, now only 4
	5:42 PM	Jason:	still way more than I need
	5:44 PM	Jessica:	Exactly, I had 4 added Hunter got 8, he blew though it all in first week. I had carryover the month before, barely use 1. Ugh, learning period. Though currently he can’t use any for who knows how long 😂
	5:45 PM	Jason:	True. Can you check that Brenna’s phone limit is no more than 3.5GB? I want some data left for my occasional use. I think I thought our limit was still 8GB when I set her up.
	5:45 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	5:46 PM	Jason:	Jeez, using YouTube just to listen to music is nutty, in my old person opinion.
	5:47 PM	Jessica:	It was at 4
	5:51 PM	Jason:	glad you checked :) thanks
	5:52 PM	Jessica:	No problem. I may have cried a bit paying a 400 bill this month, I get it 😥 no idea how they go through that much. Videos and Pokemon go is my guess
	5:57 PM	Jason:	Ouch. I’ve had phantom phone vibration in my pocket all day (even now with phone out). Maybe related.
	5:59 PM	Jessica:	Part was adding him, 150 new phone, 30 overage. Expecting normal next month with having it turned off.
	6:04 PM	Jason:	I meowed at the cat like she’s meowing at me and it scared her
	6:04 PM	Jason:	I’m sure she’ll remember that
	6:05 PM	Jessica:	Yep, you’ll pay for that
	6:07 PM	Jessica:	She just brought me her phone for the wifi password. Think it may have been off since here
	6:07 PM	Jason:	I meant remember as in lesson learned not revenge, sheesh
	6:08 PM	Jason:	Makes sense
	6:08 PM	Jessica:	Nope... payback at some point I’m sure
	6:09 PM	Jason:	She’s always lurking, scheming. No matter where I go in the house (upstairs, bathroom) she’s always just a few feet away, watching.
	6:09 PM	Jason:	Almost like I’m being experimented upon and she’s taking notes.
	6:10 PM	Jessica:	😂
	6:10 PM	Jason:	Reporting back to cat central.
	6:10 PM	Jessica:	That’s how I feel about the kids sometimes. Like please can I pee by myself??
	6:10 PM	Jason:	Little aliens, all of them.

	8:54 AM	Jessica:	Did the mortgage get paid?
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	crap, principal again
	8:55 AM	Jason:	I assume so but I don’t check it since it should be automatic. I was thinking this morning I still need t transfer to you.
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	looks like it didn’t heads up.
	8:56 AM	Jason:	Jeez, it didn’t pay. I guess the account didn’t actually have enough funds on withdrawal day.
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	Is it horrible that I physically cringe when I see Timberline call during the day?
	8:57 AM	Jason:	No
	8:57 AM	Jason:	Timberline letter in mail yesterday, knew right away it would be about Hunter
	8:57 AM	Jason:	Just the absences warning
	8:57 AM	Jason:	*would be negative about Hunter
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	Hunter has 5 tardies in 5th (class after lunch) actually 8 but teacher knocked a couple off. He’s not coming back from lunch on time...shocker
	8:59 AM	Jason:	Wonder where he’s going. Yeah, that’s Algebra, I think.
	9:00 AM	Jason:	Web site gives error when I try to pay online. Calling ICCU ...
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	I hear”Moooom” when I woke him up this morning. My immediate response: 'Don’t even THINK about telling me you have a headache”
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	that’s weird
	9:08 AM	Jason:	I think it was a 12 year-old who helped me. He didn’t have good answers but made the transfer.
	9:09 AM	Jessica:	He probably was 😂
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	Trying to recover my shared calendars at work... So tired of this
	9:10 AM	Jason:	ugh
	9:10 AM	Jason:	sent you $300
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	This guy seems older than 12 and speaks English so I have high hopes
	9:11 AM	Jason:	:)
	9:18 AM	Jessica:	Okay so maybe my hopes were too high
	9:18 AM	Jason:	tech people usually suck
	9:21 AM	Jessica:	On another topic, Deborah wants to know if Piper can stay Friday night and both do make up Saturday (we would be picking up Friday and taking Saturday. They will be out of town I messaged to have the girls do a makeup. I can keep them with me or take in the morning if easier, don’t want to commit for you
	9:31 AM	Jason:	That’s fine. No problem staying with me. What time Saturday?
	9:31 AM	Jessica:	pretty sure it’s 9-1, waiting for Megan to email me back
	9:35 AM	Jason:	no problem. i’ll make them waffles and bring them.
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	sounds good
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	not chili but beef stew will have to do
	1:53 PM	Jason:	beef stew sounds pretty good. launch day here so pizza was provided. seems to happen a lot.
	1:54 PM	Jessica:	I was about to say, lots of pizza lately
	1:57 PM	Jason:	random other subject: how did Kayla’s surgery go?
	1:58 PM	Jessica:	postponed, he wan’t able to get the surgical room
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	wasn’t
	4:02 PM	Jessica:	https://boiseescape.com/special-events/
	4:03 PM	Jason:	oh, i thought you were inviting me camping
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	https://escapethisliveboise.com/birthday-parties/
	4:04 PM	Jessica:	funny, it’s already to cold in the morning just to get to work!
	4:05 PM	Jason:	i still don’t get the concept of an escape room. will have to watch more videos.
	4:05 PM	Jason:	i play “escape the mountains” a couple times every year.
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	https://escaperoomboise.com/
	4:06 PM	Jessica:	They do look fun, I’ve wanted to try it
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	They are a bit challenging, made for adults and under 14 needs an adult in there so we will probably be doing it with them
	4:11 PM	Jason:	hooray. at least not smelly teens.
	4:14 PM	Jessica:	good point
	4:52 PM	Jason:	Any idea why garage here is standing open?
	4:52 PM	Jessica:	Hunter should be there. Tuesday, late start tomorrow
	4:53 PM	Jason:	Oh, didn’t know hunter was coming to watch tv
	4:53 PM	Jason:	I had locked all doors
	4:54 PM	Jason:	What does late start mean for him coming here?
	4:55 PM	Jason:	Don’t mind, just didn’t know
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	To stay because of late Wednesday school. Should not be on TV
	4:55 PM	Jason:	Okay, didn’t know that plan
	4:59 PM	Jessica:	Latr start meaning I can’t take or will be late unless he goes early. Oh, thought it was mentioned. I can get him after class if needed. He can go early
	4:59 PM	Jason:	No worries. Was just surprised since I’d made a point to lock up house. I like doing algebra, though. And it makes sense.
	5:01 PM	Jason:	Maybe sushi algebra night
	5:01 PM	Jessica:	He needs to do algebra, English. Etc. He’s didn’t work on those, it’s been all about the reading that HAD to be read by today 🤔
	5:29 PM	Jason:	He finished the reading once the tv was off
	6:03 PM	Jessica:	Should have already been done. I Has been the babysitting battle
	6:04 PM	Jason:	Now he’s resting because it was hard and his leg hurts :)
	6:14 PM	Jessica:	It’s exhausting to do nothing
	8:59 PM	Jason:	cat’s insane because she’s in heat (looked up symptoms); hunter in jet bath to recover from his brutal day; i’m watching subtitled mystery series with angst ridden investigators
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	Warned you... Don’t let her out or kittens 😂
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	Of course he is
	9:17 PM	Jessica:	I hate common core
	9:18 PM	Jason:	what part?
	9:19 PM	Jessica:	Math...the way that have them do it all these long ways
	9:21 PM	Jason:	wish i could help
	9:21 PM	Jessica:	Luckily only two problems
	9:22 PM	Jason:	you can do this
	9:23 PM	Jessica:	You are not helpful

Wednesday, September 19, 2018

	10:21 AM	Jessica:	and call from the principal again....
	10:24 AM	Jessica:	I give up\
	10:24 AM	Jason:	what?! he was up and going when i left at 8
	10:24 AM	Jason:	i woke him up at 7:40
	10:25 AM	Jason:	or was it about something else?
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	tardy for 5th again yesterday AFTER they had called that morning
	10:25 AM	Jason:	oh. well, don’t let him go off campus
	10:25 AM	Jason:	i thought that was a privilege
	10:25 AM	Jason:	they could withdraw
	10:25 AM	Jessica:	so he has Saturday school again, is in danger of being dropped from the class...which will mean no graduating
	10:25 AM	Jason:	yea
	10:26 AM	Jason:	(sarcasm)
	10:26 AM	Jessica:	both the principal and I have told him to stay on campus, I don’t think they can enforce it
	10:26 AM	Jason:	so inexplicable since the work is easy for him
	10:27 AM	Jason:	he didn’t want to do sushi/homework last night, which was a surprise since he seemed to like that
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	Oh I’m sure it’s not that. It’s having absolutely no respect for anybody else’s time or his future especially if it interferes with his social life
	10:28 AM	Jason:	:(
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	It’s going to break my heart when I have to send him to his dad’s or let him be on his own in December, but it’s looking pretty bleak. He’s not putting even an ounce of effort in
	10:28 AM	Jason:	i know, i know
	10:38 AM	Jason:	we have a style sheet (CSS thing, remember) that we code named oscar, for whatever reason. It includes font stylings.
	10:39 AM	Jason:	then we hired a guy whose name is literally Oscar Font
	10:39 AM	Jason:	it’s confusing
	10:39 AM	Jason:	just met Oscar Font over video chat
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	that HILARIOUS
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	21 missing assignments now
	1:27 PM	Jason:	crazy
	1:27 PM	Jason:	any math? he was telling me last night, since i offered twice to help with math, that he didn’t have any sheets to work on
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	oh he’s full of it. I made him put the ones he left in his bag. Not sure which ones actually got done in class/seminar as he said some did, but as usual don’t believe it
	1:28 PM	Jason:	i guess i can look myself
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:34 PM	Jason:	failure is imminent there
	1:34 PM	Jason:	can’t do much to fix the quizes
	1:35 PM	Jessica:	especially since he chose not to correct them when given the opportunity there
	1:36 PM	Jessica:	You got the email about 504 meeting at 7:20 tomorrow right?
	2:00 PM	Jason:	I don’t see that e-mail. AM?
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	yep
	2:00 PM	Jason:	Usual place? Admin conference room?
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	assuming so
	2:01 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:02 PM	Jason:	nerf gun fight just erupted after two guys bought their own, larger guns
	2:04 PM	Jason:	i was caught in crossfire, had to go under desk
	2:39 PM	Jessica:	oh lordy
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	how much beer have you all had?
	2:40 PM	Jason:	that’s a good idea, actually. i try not to have any before 3, though
	2:41 PM	Jessica:	almost.....
	3:26 PM	Jason:	i can’t work in these conditions. keg blew.
	3:58 PM	Jessica:	rough work environment
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	Just realized I’m not sure where Hunter landed after school. Message me if he’s at your house
	4:02 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:53 PM	Jason:	He’s here watching tv
	4:53 PM	Jason:	Making waffles
	5:05 PM	Jessica:	Okay, I can pick him up when I get girls. Tracy taking Dana and I to dinner
	5:05 PM	Jason:	Nice (dinner)
	5:06 PM	Jessica:	Sushi so hopefully safe ordering
	5:06 PM	Jason:	Ooh, epic ready

	5:12 PM	Jessica:	Don’t recall you saying anything
	5:12 PM	Jason:	Just getting her warmed up to the idea
	5:13 PM	Jason:	She didn’t say much but didn’t object
	5:13 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, she send a bit more open about it. Had a little meltdown when she got here and we discussed
	5:13 PM	Jason:	Then finding her a counselor?
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, just want her to see it’s not a scary thing
	5:14 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:56 PM	Jason:	sushi albegra

	7:01 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:02 PM	Jason:	I just learned that the underwater thing I’ve always called perriwinkle is actually a caddisfly larvae. Perriwinkles are little snails.
	7:05 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	7:09 PM	Jason:	are you puking at larvae or your dinner?
	7:09 PM	Jessica:	Not a good discussion when about to order sushi
	7:11 PM	Jason:	sissy
	8:27 PM	Jessica:	Am I getting Hunter?
	8:28 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	8:28 PM	Jason:	After girls you said

	4:09 PM	Jessica:	forgot, blew it off to hang with friends..who knows anymore
	4:09 PM	Jason:	i know, super frustrating for you to leave work for it
	4:54 PM	Jason:	Hunter wants to call
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	6:22 PM	Jason:	You unfriended me on Facebook? That’s weird.
	6:25 PM	Jessica:	I took you off when things were not good, when we were going towards a fault divorce when you took me off Instagram. Thought it best to create some space if things weren’t going to be amicable
	6:27 PM	Jason:	I never took you off Instagram. Jeez, I think I was logged in once with Google or something instead of my regular account and couldn’t find you. Was wondering just the other day why I can’t see your Instagram either.
	6:28 PM	Jason:	Well, was trying to share Brenna pictures.
	6:37 PM	Jason:	I can’t share to you anymore but these are today’s pictures
	6:39 PM	Jessica:	Hmmmm, not sure why. One sec
	6:41 PM	Jason:	“Jessica Abbott doesn’t allow people to post on their Timeline."
	6:41 PM	Jessica:	Yep, see it
	6:43 PM	Jason:	My powers have been returned to me. I will use them only for the betterment of mankind.
	6:44 PM	Jessica:	Use wisely, be warned if people post events etc to my timeline I’m turning it back off 😂
	6:45 PM	Jessica:	Good pics
	6:46 PM	Jason:	Went with guy at work who’s interested in photography. Sort of like Jess Jackson.
	6:46 PM	Jason:	He’s the one shooting in one of the pictures.
	6:51 PM	Jessica:	He just starting or been at it awhile?
	7:06 PM	Jason:	He’s kind of getting started. Appreciated my tips.
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	10:32 PM	Jessica:	Just so you aren’t offended about Instagram. I don’t mind adding you back but I’m hearing about massive uploads... Which I’m not sure you realize dominates people’s feeds since it’s not quite meant to be used as a photo book upload. So then you can’t see anything else your following. Also when I just looked I was rather sad. Beautiful pictures of course, but it’s been noticed not a single one of Hunter or Kayla. Feels like a very pick and choose of the perception of your life you want to show. Which I get somewhat, but considering these are the last many years of life with your family you are putting out there.... well.

Friday, September 21, 2018

	8:39 AM	Jason:	Yeah, recently came across a Lightroom to Instagram plugin and seemed a good time to replace 500px that nobody looks at. My first picks were Brenna favorites + Trail Image scenics + Saturday Market sellers.

I clicked “Publish” and realized just what you said about spamming so all the rest, including other kids, are coming just five per day. Last I looked, it will take about a month at that pace. Then they’ll all be there.

In any case, I was asking about being removed from your followers, not you following me on there. I’ll probably never use it to upload current photos so not much point in that.
	9:26 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	9:27 AM	Jessica:	Brenna wants to be Mary Poppins for Halloween
	9:28 AM	Jason:	That’s a fun change. Could be cute.

	10:09 AM	Jason:	they were talking about brenna’s assault for the rest of the afternoon
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	It was pretty funny. It was mentioned here that we don’t have Nerf guns, for some reason not sure clients would like it Trent said 😂
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Something about being professional 🤔
	10:12 AM	Jason:	yeah. clients are a bummer.
	10:12 AM	Jason:	custodian lady told me she let brenna know where extra candy stash was

	10:12 AM	Jason:	you know the routine
	10:13 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, was surprised she stayed till 5 here. Busy coloring pics for people and getting into snacks
	10:17 AM	Jason:	She got into extrovert mode

	11:47 AM	Jason:	modes of brenna

	1:00 PM	Jason:	so hopefully the kegs are replaced
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	yeah, that’s a lot of pizza and beer
	1:37 PM	Jason:	Room lights here shut off after no movement for a while. Wondered if that includes the bathroom if you sit in there. Answer: yes.
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	we may have a shot still at getting him enlisted
	2:29 PM	Jason:	that’s good news
	2:30 PM	Jessica:	just spoke with the person in charge of getting waivers approved
	2:30 PM	Jason:	how soon might we know?
	2:33 PM	Jessica:	Just need to have Dr. Tolman do a civilian test and sign off that his hearing is below the H3 threshold. Make sure ears cleaned, no headphones the week before, sleep with earplugs the night before. Also sign off that he doesn’t have insomnia/sleepwalking problems because he said he did so now need documented from doctor he doesn’t. MEPS hadn’t uploaded his record yet so he is getting them Monday to confirm there isn’t anything else we need Tolman to address, then he will submit the waiver
	2:45 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:45 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:46 PM	Jessica:	shred of hope
	2:46 PM	Jason:	Yeah, hope, hooe
	2:46 PM	Jessica:	beer in the mug I’m guessing
	2:46 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	2:48 PM	Jason:	I just bought a package of earplugs so covered for that little part :)
	2:49 PM	Jason:	I wish we were playing ping pong instead
	2:49 PM	Jessica:	guess you better become a gamer
	2:50 PM	Jason:	hmmm
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	life goal
	2:51 PM	Jason:	fer sur
	2:52 PM	Jason:	and another gun battle just erupted. shot in the kidney, raspy breaths. starting to see family members who’ve passed ...
	2:52 PM	Jessica:	no more beer for you
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	you can update Hunter on the info when you see him later
	2:55 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:55 PM	Jessica:	if you survive
	2:55 PM	Jason:	shopping for better nerf gun https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Zombie-Strike-Doominator-Blaster/dp/B00U5UEMSG/ref=sr_1_7?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1537563255&sr=1-7&keywords=nerf+gun
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	I’m trying to come up with a really smart ass response but I’m just speechless at this point
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	2 hour meeting time...no fun here in Nampa for me
	2:59 PM	Jason:	ugh
	2:59 PM	Jason:	(standard nampa response)
	4:13 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:13 PM	Jason:	Taking turns on the one wheel
	5:14 PM	Jason:	Hunter asking if you’ll bring his stuff over
	5:14 PM	Jason:	Not sure what that amounts to
	5:15 PM	Jason:	Hopefully not ncluding pillow and blankets because that’s stupid
	5:16 PM	Jason:	Homework is all he really needs
	5:26 PM	Jason:	I did alright on one wheel
	5:26 PM	Jessica:	Nice
	5:26 PM	Jason:	Won one pong, killed in another
	5:26 PM	Jessica:	Not sure what he thinks he needs
	5:27 PM	Jason:	Clothes is what he said
	5:27 PM	Jason:	He literally hasn’t done laundry here since you left
	5:27 PM	Jason:	So maybe just needs that
	5:28 PM	Jason:	I ask him and Brenna every Sunday when I do it
	5:29 PM	Jessica:	Tomorrow
	5:32 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:48 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:48 PM	Jessica:	Oh boy

Saturday, September 22, 2018

	9:10 AM	Jessica:	So he got a phone somewhere?
	10:07 AM	Jason:	Maybe Brenna’s
	10:17 AM	Jessica:	Ahhh, gotcha
	10:23 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:23 AM	Jason:	Pretty sure piper only eats candy
	10:23 AM	Jessica:	You are correct 😂
	10:26 AM	Jason:	Putting sugar on her brownie
	10:31 AM	Jessica:	Oh god
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	Peanut butter banana smoothie for me
	10:33 AM	Jason:	That sounds good
	10:33 AM	Jason:	I think I’ll try to fast today
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	I’ve been doing the nothing past 8pm until noon
	10:34 AM	Jason:	That sounds hard
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	Helps my digestion a lot
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	Sometimes, used to it now. Or if really need something like this morning stick with a smoothie
	10:46 AM	Jason:	Didn’t know she writes articles
	10:46 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:47 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:48 AM	Jessica:	And books
	10:48 AM	Jason:	I knew the books
	10:51 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	10:51 AM	Jason:	That’s who Brenna and I saw at jump
	10:52 AM	Jason:	When she had to explain it to me
	10:52 AM	Jason:	Cosplay, dad
	10:52 AM	Jessica:	That’s funny
	10:52 AM	Jason:	I just thought wtf
	11:10 AM	Jason:	Guess that wasn’t Brenna’s phone. Hers is g5 not g2. And just checked her phone.
	11:10 AM	Jason:	Maybe a friends?
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	Must be, have him hand it over
	11:11 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:11 AM	Jason:	Shouldn’t be able to connect to our wifi
	11:13 AM	Jessica:	I think he can connect to neighbors
	11:13 AM	Jason:	Oh
	11:14 AM	Jason:	That must be my old phone, now that I think of it
	11:14 AM	Jason:	Before the iphone
	11:15 AM	Jason:	Haven’t seen it in a long time
	11:15 AM	Jason:	Was on the desk up there
	11:16 AM	Jessica:	I’m not surprised at all
	11:23 AM	Jason:	He tried to deny it
	11:24 AM	Jason:	I just ignored him
	11:24 AM	Jessica:	Of course he did
	11:24 AM	Jason:	Taking a long time to get it
	1:03 PM	Jason:	Girls delivered, shopping done, phone secured. Next up: we could save some attorney fees by agreeing to some additional financials like child support and debts.
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	Productive day so far for you
	1:07 PM	Jessica:	I’m open to discussion. Pretty sure child support etc is all a formula
	1:08 PM	Jason:	Right, but based on “Guideline Income” which we don’t have for your side since it includes expected annual bonuses
	1:08 PM	Jason:	You had told me to expect 55K with your new position so I’d started with that
	1:10 PM	Jason:	https://isc.idaho.gov/rules/irflp/Rule126_07.01.17.pdf
	1:12 PM	Jason:	I think we agree on all the other variables, i.e. time with each of us, who is paying health insurance ...
	1:17 PM	Jessica:	My base salary is 36, goes to 40 once tests complete, 10 potential in bonuses
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Agreed on the custody etc
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Stupid fly season
	1:18 PM	Jason:	I know. Ava came by the other day and left the door open. Took days to get the flies out.
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	The zapper is getting lots of use
	1:21 PM	Jason:	We’re fly free though it may just be they’ve all migrated to Hunter’s room.
	1:21 PM	Jason:	Gave him a few dollars to buy bike tube since he got up enough motivation to want to fix it himself.
	1:24 PM	Jessica:	I was just thinking I wonder how long he’s had that phone. Found charger with web box in his room and he’s been quick to go to bed at night because “he’s reading”
	1:26 PM	Jason:	Probably a long time. He reset it before giving it back to me, hence how long it took him.
	1:34 PM	Jessica:	Of course
	4:58 PM	Jason:	Doh. Girls are back.
	4:59 PM	Jessica:	Sounds like that had fun, your break is over
	7:13 PM	Jessica:	Tell Hunter Scott wants him to call
	7:14 PM	Jason:	He did a few hours ago
	7:15 PM	Jessica:	Wow... shocked.
	7:16 PM	Jason:	Didn’t talk long
	7:16 PM	Jessica:	The other downside to him not having his phone, Scott constantly messages
	7:16 PM	Jason:	Now messaging me too
	7:17 PM	Jessica:	When he has it I can just say....he has it,  sorry he’s avoiding you
	7:17 PM	Jessica:	Oh jeez, sorry
	7:18 PM	Jason:	Only yesterday and today
	7:19 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, I was supposed to have you tell him to call yesterday.. forgot. Also figured he wouldn’t
	7:19 PM	Jessica:	But with nothing but homework to do....
	7:22 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	7:22 PM	Jason:	Piper complaining about my grocery shopping
	7:23 PM	Jason:	No snacks
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Wait, she’s still there?
	7:23 PM	Jason:	Yes
	7:23 PM	Jason:	Her grandma left her
	7:23 PM	Jason:	I’m ready for her to be gone for now
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Ummmm, that wasn’t the plan
	7:24 PM	Jason:	I never hear about plans
	7:24 PM	Jessica:	She was supposed to get the girls and keep Piper
	7:24 PM	Jason:	Kids just show up
	7:24 PM	Jessica:	I wouldn’t have committed you to two days without discussion.
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	I can’t handle her two days
	7:25 PM	Jason:	I think her grandma needed a break
	7:25 PM	Jessica:	From? She’s been at school gymnastics and your house!
	7:25 PM	Jason:	She doesn’t want any food I have so I think she’ll want to leave soon
	7:26 PM	Jason:	Grandma took them to discovery center
	7:26 PM	Jessica:	Yeah... supposedly vegetarian. From what I can tell she only eats junk
	7:27 PM	Jason:	I don’t think vegetarian is the word for that
	7:27 PM	Jessica:	I’m sorry, will definitely mention something to Deborah
	7:27 PM	Jessica:	Reading over messages now to see if I missed something
	7:28 PM	Jessica:	Best if u or my mom can take can take to gym friday and jase can pic up and keep her friday and bring to sat make up. Then  my mom will pick up girls drop brenna and then keep pipes
	7:30 PM	Jessica:	Brenna asking to stay at Piper’s so maybe she dropped then for a bit? Confused. Talk to the girls
	7:31 PM	Jessica:	Have been trying to break then of that. Calling/messaging me when you are right there
	7:31 PM	Jason:	I said no to them
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Grandma just picked her up
	7:31 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Piper going on about how she didn’t eat
	7:31 PM	Jason:	Fridge full of fruit
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	Oh, Deborah is aware. I have mentioned before
	7:32 PM	Jason:	Strawberries, apples, grapes
	7:32 PM	Jason:	I didn’t mind, really
	7:32 PM	Jason:	I was just now at my limit
	7:32 PM	Jason:	Grandma came back when she said she would
	7:35 PM	Jessica:	Didn’t say anything, did message her that Piper probably have had a decent meal since will only eat junk or sugar. All other offerings turned down
	7:37 PM	Jason:	Brenna waiting to hear back from you
	7:37 PM	Jason:	She want me to be in trouble for not allowing another sleepover
	7:37 PM	Jason:	*wants
	7:37 PM	Jessica:	Ummmmmm
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	Don’t ask me when Dad has already answered
	7:38 PM	Jason:	I’m getting stink eyes
	7:39 PM	Jessica:	She said you didn’t
	7:39 PM	Jason:	Phbbbt
	7:39 PM	Jason:	Pants on fire
	7:40 PM	Jason:	They were begging, begging, I was saying no, no, no, no
	7:40 PM	Jessica:	Oh, I know
	7:41 PM	Jessica:	No, two nights is always to much
	7:41 PM	Jason:	* [oh, never mind]
	7:42 PM	Jessica:	Yeah..... Don’t you dare
	7:42 PM	Jessica:	I’m swipe texting... It’s my phone
	7:44 PM	Jason:	that explains it
	7:45 PM	Jessica:	😁
	8:18 PM	Jessica:	Sounds like cat still in heat😂
	8:19 PM	Jason:	She seemed recovered yesterday but not so much today
	8:19 PM	Jessica:	Brenna worried it hurts her. I said it does but will pass and then get her fixed
	8:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	8:21 PM	Jessica:	Okay, no more beer for you

Sunday, September 23, 2018

	12:17 PM	Jessica:	So Hunter needs the hearing test done and an appointment at St. Lukes sleep Medicine to show he doesn’t have insomnia etc....ugh
	12:18 PM	Jason:	sounds kind of arduous
	12:18 PM	Jason:	so he has to sleep overnight there? he definitely has weird sleep habits but probably just because he’s dinging around
	12:18 PM	Jason:	still asleep
	12:18 PM	Jason:	brenna, on the other hand, was up early and did all her homework
	12:18 PM	Jessica:	yeah, will definitely need to keep him on a normal schedule
	12:19 PM	Jessica:	yes, she is good that way
	12:19 PM	Jessica:	currently doing mine😡
	12:19 PM	Jason:	now i hear her voicing some imagination characters (don’t know which) in her room
	12:19 PM	Jason:	yea, homework for you
	12:19 PM	Jason:	getting close on it?
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	yep, if it wasn’t so boring and the tests weren’t designed to trick you, that would make it easier
	12:21 PM	Jason:	right. we’ve chatted about all that. i can’t remember boring stuff. would hate to be studied on it.
	12:21 PM	Jason:	*tested on it
	12:54 PM	Jason:	Going to Shopko for socks and bike riding gloves for Brenna. Should she need anything else?
	12:56 PM	Jessica:	Shouldn’t, I got her two packages of underwear. Maybe a few leggings now that it’s getting cooler because those are cheap there, buy she has some so not a priority. Crap, I have her helmet. Will drop it later with some Hunter’s clothes
	12:57 PM	Jason:	and scratchy
	12:57 PM	Jessica:	Oh, thought she had it. Told her to put in her bag. Would have brought earlier.
	12:58 PM	Jason:	bringing her to zoo tonight. you’re welcome to come.
	1:02 PM	Jessica:	When is that? Will depend on where my studies are
	1:02 PM	Jason:	5:30
	1:02 PM	Jason:	some event
	1:02 PM	Jason:	got free tickets from work
	1:02 PM	Jason:	curious to see progress and the primate enclosures that were gone last time we visited
	1:03 PM	Jason:	*on the

	2:08 PM	Jessica:	that’s cute, nice ears
	2:11 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	accurate
	2:15 PM	Jason:	Tried to have fit because I wouldn’t get coat until I see what she has
	2:17 PM	Jessica:	yeah, can’t remember if she got a new one last year. I know she has the blue/black one but not sure if getting small with as much as she’s grown
	2:38 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:38 PM	Jason:	With help from the cat
	2:39 PM	Jessica:	😂
	2:40 PM	Jason:	got about three leggings and pack of socks and knitted gloves
	2:42 PM	Jessica:	she should stay nice and warm
	3:30 PM	Jason:	Hunter wants me to remind you to bring his clothes. He’s having a tough day laying in bed.
	3:35 PM	Jessica:	I’ll grab some, not sure what he wants.
	3:37 PM	Jason:	His floor is littered with clothes. And like I said, he’s never done a single load of laundry (or accepted my offer to wash some if he’ll bring them to me) so it’s really his problem to solve.
	3:37 PM	Jason:	I would choose to bring something that seems humorous to you.
	3:47 PM	Jason:	Brenna has been retrieved
	3:47 PM	Jason:	by Ava
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	Naturally
	4:44 PM	Jason:	I didn’t know Brenna was going to pester you. I was clear that you going to the zoo was a MAYBE depending on your homework.
	4:49 PM	Jessica:	It’s okay
	4:49 PM	Jason:	I just heard her squeal
	5:08 PM	Jessica:	so meet in front of the zoo 5:30?
	5:08 PM	Jason:	yeah
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	7:53 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:53 PM	Jason:	Now with jalapeños
	7:54 PM	Jessica:	oh lordy
	7:55 PM	Jessica:	looks pretty good...except for jalapenos
	8:14 PM	Jason:	jet bath for hunter. says he isn’t feeling well. let him know about health testing. he said he’s already been diagnosed with insomnia.
	8:17 PM	Jessica:	no, he has not
	8:18 PM	Jason:	i figured the truth was probably reverse of anything he said.
	8:18 PM	Jessica:	To be diagnosed he would have had to go through a sleep study, like the one he’s about to do
	8:19 PM	Jessica:	and the fact that we’ve NEVER heard about his “insomnia issue”
	8:21 PM	Jason:	i told him i didn’t know dates yet but we were finding out. he just needed to get good rest.
	8:49 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:49 PM	Jason:	Not a ruler fan
	8:49 PM	Jason:	Not my child

	9:03 AM	Jason:	good job :)
	9:04 AM	Jessica:	:)
	9:04 AM	Jessica:	So did Hunter go to school?
	9:05 AM	Jason:	I don’t think so. I got him up, he came downstairs, then the sick excuse. I guess I should call.
	9:05 AM	Jason:	He was coughing and seemed sick but who knows ...
	9:06 AM	Jessica:	I email her
	9:15 AM	Jason:	which “her” is it?

	11:24 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:45 AM	Jason:	god, my energy level jest went over a cliff. wonder if hunter really is spreading some disease. fighting back with salad cube.
	11:48 AM	Jessica:	Oh no....
	11:56 AM	Jason:	should have used more fresh jalapenos. not hot enough.
	12:04 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:53 PM	Jason:	sorry about this but i was doing a quick google to see if there’s a general name for hot dog roasting sticks (writing up Brenna’s and my last ride) and found this
	12:53 PM	Jason:	https://i.etsystatic.com/6959854/r/il/1c69a5/796774978/il_570xN.796774978_cbrf.jpg
	12:54 PM	Jason:	who thinks of these things?
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	That is so wrong and funny at the same time
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	Okay, so could book the Wizards room for up to 12 for $300. She currently has 9 on her list
	1:29 PM	Jessica:	https://escapethisliveboise.com/the-wizards-final-exam/
	1:30 PM	Jason:	i guess that sounds awesome
	1:31 PM	Jessica:	If max of 8 can do the pirates ship which is 225 but think she will have to many because not that I think of it I didn’t include her
	1:31 PM	Jason:	which day? the 13th?
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	336 for the 13th or 300 for Sunday the 14th
	1:32 PM	Jason:	happy to save dollars but otherwise no preference. what do you think?
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	There are plenty of spots for the 14th, save the 40 for the cake
	1:34 PM	Jason:	2pm?
	1:34 PM	Jessica:	yeah
	1:35 PM	Jason:	hmm, that says “adults” -- not sure what that means really
	1:37 PM	Jessica:	yeah odd, 264. It is for a private room 12 people
	1:39 PM	Jason:	i don’t know which to book, then
	1:39 PM	Jessica:	I like 264 better
	1:39 PM	Jason:	which one is that?
	1:40 PM	Jessica:	2pm private room 12 people no discounts
	1:40 PM	Jessica:	14th
	1:41 PM	Jason:	okay, even though it says “adults”?
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	yep, because booking the whole room, no others grouped in to ours
	1:42 PM	Jason:	hmm, checkout is giving errors
	1:43 PM	Jason:	“This price does not appear to match our records”
	1:43 PM	Jason:	I guess a problem in their configuration
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	208-509-9347
	1:44 PM	Jessica:	He said can text or call if questions
	1:45 PM	Jason:	started over and it worked
	1:45 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	1:45 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	1:46 PM	Jessica:	She’s going to be excited. Better hit the dollar store for invitations
	1:47 PM	Jason:	oh, we have to go to a place, it’s not the RV one, i guess
	1:48 PM	Jessica:	yep, not rv
	1:48 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:48 PM	Jessica:	I don’t want to be in an RV with 10 girls 😂
	3:55 PM	Jessica:	don’t forget scratchy
	3:55 PM	Jason:	oh yeah. i guess scratchy gets another downtown walk. on my way.
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	it’s weekly walk
	3:57 PM	Jason:	Need to get leash
	4:01 PM	Jason:	How do you always get that spot?
	4:02 PM	Jessica:	I’m here before most people sadly
	4:07 PM	Jason:	I get the same spot everyday too
	4:07 PM	Jessica:	well...yeah
	4:11 PM	Jason:	Brenna went to Piper’s without asking. What should the consequence be? Grounded from friends for a while?
	4:12 PM	Jason:	“And um dad I’m at pipers house bc she wanted me to bike so we are doing homework Sorry for not telling u”
	4:13 PM	Jason:	I’m thinking grounded from friends or special treats (after gymnastics) for a week.
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, definitely not okay without permission
	4:18 PM	Jason:	I’m going to message Deborah and let her know since Brenna says she was coerced by Piper. No excuse whatsoever but want it clear on both ends.
	4:18 PM	Jason:	Too far for her to decide to bike unilaterally.
	4:19 PM	Jessica:	Exactly! glad there is a bike path the whole way but she has a phone, could have called to ask. That she didn’t means she knew the odds were the answer would be no
	4:20 PM	Jason:	right
	4:22 PM	Jason:	Sounds like Andrew is home but both he and Deborah had told Piper that Brenna shouldn’t come over. Anyway, consequences coming ...
	4:25 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:27 PM	Jessica:	yeah, especially since Piper had been told no as well. Need to nip that in the bud quickly
	4:27 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:28 PM	Jessica:	it was Piper’s fault she didn’t call or message for permission? okay Hunter
	4:28 PM	Jason:	Exactly. Me and scratch are biking now.
	6:33 PM	Jessica:	Heads up, making Brenna grouchy
	6:34 PM	Jason:	oh good
	6:35 PM	Jessica:	She arguing with me to bring clothes over because she must wear her Adidas pants and nothing there matches it 😂🤨🤔
	6:36 PM	Jessica:	I told her I would drop stuff tomorrow, haven’t done her laundry and she can wait a day.
	6:38 PM	Jason:	Oh, the horror
	6:40 PM	Jessica:	First world problems
	6:47 PM	Jason:	Definitely
	8:28 PM	Jessica:	Damn, not feeling so hot
	8:28 PM	Jason:	Uh oh
	8:28 PM	Jason:	I’m still sort of on the edge. Not really sick but more worn out than I should be.
	8:29 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, not good timing. Definitely no energy, face on fire. Bath and bed
	8:29 PM	Jason:	Yep. Even NPR if you need it.
	8:30 PM	Jessica:	Can barely keep eyes open so think I’m good 😳
	8:36 PM	Jason:	get good sleep
	8:36 PM	Jason:	we have a little earlier morning for choir
	8:37 PM	Jessica:	Oh yes choir
	8:38 PM	Jessica:	Hunter has hearing test Friday. Let him know no head phones before then
	8:40 PM	Jason:	message conveyed
	8:40 PM	Jason:	“alrighty”
	8:58 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:59 PM	Jason:	Drawing contest
	9:14 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:16 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:17 PM	Jessica:	To bed for me
	9:17 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Tuesday, September 25, 2018

	11:33 AM	Jessica:	better but still a bit drained
	11:34 AM	Jason:	better is good
	11:34 AM	Jason:	i feel a bit worse. not awful but working from home since i have to drive to gymnastics anyway
	11:35 AM	Jessica:	good idea. Did Hunter go to school?
	11:35 AM	Jason:	oh yeah
	11:35 AM	Jason:	i got him up. sent him on his way
	11:35 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:37 AM	Jason:	brought brenna to choir
	12:51 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully she enjoys it
	4:41 PM	Jason:	She said she liked it. She wouldn’t say much else with Piper in the car.
	7:41 PM	Jessica:	Forwarded an email. Not 100% sure it applies to Brenna as it was a bcc to me but in case
	8:04 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:05 PM	Jason:	I’ll quiz her

Wednesday, September 26, 2018

	8:22 AM	Jessica:	Hunter was absent first period yesterday
	8:29 AM	Jason:	I saw him up and leave
	8:29 AM	Jason:	Just like I got him up today
	8:29 AM	Jason:	What time does first period start?
	8:32 AM	Jessica:	7:45
	8:32 AM	Jessica:	today I think is 8:10 or 8:5 because it’s Wednesday
	8:32 AM	Jessica:	15
	8:36 AM	Jason:	okay. i think i had him up in plenty of time for the 7:45 but am not positive. i get up at 7:00 on kid weeks and wake hunter up after shower.
	8:36 AM	Jason:	of course, he’s 17 and could very well manage this himself
	8:36 AM	Jason:	i bet he tells the teachers its your fault, though, for taking his phone
	8:37 AM	Jessica:	most likely, I’m sure the teachers wouldn’t buy that from him though 😂
	8:38 AM	Jason:	reminds me, copy of 504 plan came from school. i’ll file it unless you want it.
	8:38 AM	Jessica:	just file, pretty sure we have many of that one, hasn’t changed
	2:07 PM	Jessica:	I PASSED!!!!
	2:07 PM	Jason:	wow, what a relief
	2:07 PM	Jason:	well done :)
	2:07 PM	Jason:	leave work, go celebrate
	2:08 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	2:08 PM	Jessica:	Have to go back to work from testing center 🤨
	2:09 PM	Jason:	you can drive slowly with the music up
	3:33 PM	Jason:	any celebration planned?
	3:41 PM	Jessica:	No, just being able to let my brain rest tonight will be celebration!
	3:42 PM	Jason:	I can see that would be most desirable. We/I’ll take you to celebrate when your brain is back.
	3:42 PM	Jason:	About to get girls. Deborah’s plans changed so pick up again.
	3:42 PM	Jessica:	as usual...
	3:43 PM	Jessica:	and we have to figure out Friday because Piper not going
	3:44 PM	Jason:	that’s part of the change. I think Deborah is taking them on Friday now.
	3:44 PM	Jason:	drive time ...
	4:24 PM	Jason:	Good golly. Waited for Piper, turned out she took bus, so Deborah asked if we’d run to get her, then Piper wouldn’t answer door. Now way too late so no gymnastics.
	4:26 PM	Jessica:	This is getting ridiculous
	4:26 PM	Jessica:	She misses again. I’m about done dealing with them
	4:26 PM	Jason:	I told Brenna I’d ask you if you’d like to celebrate with something in BoDo then pyramid races in JUMP.
	4:26 PM	Jason:	sometime
	4:27 PM	Jason:	yeah, I agree
	4:27 PM	Jason:	just don’t have a good plan B, though
	4:27 PM	Jason:	Deborah talking about Saturday makeup
	4:28 PM	Jessica:	I don’t want Brenna’s Saturdays used up because of them. And it’s not 4 hours make-up
	4:29 PM	Jason:	Brenna saying she’d rather do excel next year
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	Having battle over working hours tomorrow. Was waiting till test passed and I DOUBLE bonused. They are trying to say I’m non exempt but not accurate, or they owe me massive overtime
	4:31 PM	Jason:	Well yeah. It’s one or the other. Can’t be exempt for hours but non-exempt for bonuses.
	4:32 PM	Jason:	I thought that’s all been clear for months.
	4:33 PM	Jessica:	No nothing to do with bonuses. Saying I’m a non exempt employee. Though I’m salaried and hours not submitted.
	4:33 PM	Jason:	Oh, I see. What does it affect then?
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	I’ll dig into it later, hard my message
	4:39 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:39 PM	Jessica:	Brenna is still always able to go to gymnastics, even if a bit late. Just called, they prefer she does
	4:40 PM	Jason:	okay, will do so next time, which hopefully there isn’t
	4:40 PM	Jessica:	yeah, they sent out an email looking for another car pool person
	5:17 PM	Jessica:	Well so much for enjoying today. You can let your attorney know I will not be agreeing to the proposal
	5:18 PM	Jason:	I didn’t realize one was sent
	5:19 PM	Jessica:	Yes, and it was beyond insulting. I have nothing further to discuss
	5:22 PM	Jason:	They were using their own worksheets with the financial statements I provided going back to 2000. I still had questions so didn’t expect anything was sent.
	5:23 PM	Jessica:	Nothing is sent without you’re approval.
	5:24 PM	Jessica:	If you think I’m going to agree to 17k from retirement as fair you’re insane
	5:34 PM	Jason:	I guess I read that section differently but I can see why you would take it that way. It should be clarified that you get half the retirement funds in a rollover to your retirement account with an equalization payment as a separate thing.
	5:34 PM	Jason:	The retirement funds are simple: straight up 50% accrued during marriage.
	5:52 PM	Jessica:	section 13
	5:55 PM	Jason:	Right. I think I skimmed that a bit since HOW I make the payment shouldn’t really matter. I COULD withdraw retirement funds but at a huge penalty. I’d rather pay with another source, whatever the final amount is.
	5:57 PM	Jason:	I already sent a message to them on that point a minute ago. Yeah, I had semi-reviewed this but hadn’t gone over with a fine-toothed comb since I thought I was waiting for at least one more answer on something.
	6:02 PM	Jessica:	Well, regardless. This can move to pretrial/discovery. I don’t agree to this proposal for so many reasons.
	6:03 PM	Jason:	My last message from the paralegal today was “I will review this with Pat and see what he recommends." I was waiting on that ... haven’t had anything further.
	6:04 PM	Jason:	Sounds expensive. It think we just need the legal minds to agree about the home equity. The rest seems settled.
	6:04 PM	Jessica:	Starting to find it odd that it seems to always be “the lawyer did it” Either it’s bs or you have an asshole attorney
	6:06 PM	Jessica:	agree, expensive but we are so far apart on financials it seems inevitable.
	6:08 PM	Jason:	Getting a legal opinion on equity shouldn’t be hard. I’ve supplied my attorney with mortgage, ELOC and title statements going back to 2000. So that’s what he started with. He expected he could work with your attorney and have that equity issue solved without much trouble.
	6:10 PM	Jessica:	Mine has the same numbers titles/deeds etc. we are not even in the ballpark of a real discussion based on what I received today
	6:11 PM	Jason:	It’s not like there isn’t any case law on the matter. So once the attorneys have the same data, agreement shouldn’t be hard.
	6:15 PM	Jessica:	I find it amusing you think you and your lawyer are the only one with case data or an understanding of the law. As I said, I know for a fact without discussing with mine this proposal is rejected
	6:17 PM	Jason:	I’m not sure what gave you the idea I think that. I’m just saying the facts are simple enough the two attorneys should be able to agree.
	6:18 PM	Jason:	It would be surprising if a first proposal was accepted, I think.
	6:30 PM	Jessica:	Well they/we are on very opposite ends so I can say even as a first proposal, unless something more reasonable proposed we move forward to trial. I don’t enjoy using my bonuses/income for attorneys fees either, yet I am starting over, from scratch, rebuilding my career and trying to afford to live on this side of town to keep Brenna in the same school and create a life for her with me as well. After 11 years of marriage and 15 together of having joint everything, I am not going to be able to do that because you gave me some extra retirement. Because now not only is there a financial issue, it will become a custody one if that’s what you think is fair. You are quite simply by these calculations saying hey, you get nothing, I’ll keep everything but some retirement and also you need to be in one of the most expensive areas of Boise to agree on shared 50/50 time to keep Brenna in the same school. That is just one of many issues.
	6:34 PM	Jason:	The child support calculations are, as you say, just formulas. Keeping Brenna with the friends and teachers she’s grown up with is obviously best for her.
	6:35 PM	Jason:	You keep suggesting I’m “saying” something. I’m just supplying numbers to be plugged into worksheets.
	6:36 PM	Jessica:	Agreed and as usual totally missed the point. Keep your formulas and numbers, god forbid anybody suggests you be a human being and do the right thing.
	6:42 PM	Jason:	When you chose this direction you knew it would inevitably make elements of all our lives harder for years to come. The main “right thing” I’m concerned with, amidst that, is the kids: that they can keep their same friends and same home.
	6:46 PM	Jessica:	Don’t play blame game. YOU chose this direction for years. So far all I see you concerned with is her keeping the same school/friends with you in a house you are more attached to than any person. You haven’t even considered her having the same with me.
	6:48 PM	Jessica:	Believe me. If it was just me and we had no kids involved I would walk away in a heartbeat, keep it all, but then I would have done that years ago. As it stands I have to recreate and build over to keep her over here, which is my main concern
	6:50 PM	Jason:	There is plenty of two bedroom housing in this area easily affordable for someone with your income, even with nothing from me. It leaves me uncertain of your real concern.
	6:51 PM	Jason:	Sweet townhouses like we often said we wished for!
	6:52 PM	Jason:	No pond, no lawn to mow ... the high life.
	6:52 PM	Jessica:	Sure crazy rent on my income and nothing to put towards owning anything. You’re so smart
	6:55 PM	Jessica:	You also forget I need to pay Kayla’s college this year possibly next,  the one we got 50k to help with that went into living expenses and the house
	6:55 PM	Jessica:	So that’s another 500,  10 months of the year
	6:56 PM	Jason:	I don’t recall that ever being discussed.
	6:56 PM	Jessica:	Please tell me you’ve lost your mind
	6:56 PM	Jason:	Our conversations have all been via chat so I can just search right here. What word should I look for?
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	It was before then. Let me give you a calculation since that’s the only thing you know. We received 50k since Jeremy passed until she graduated 1000 monthly x 4 years). We discussed whether to put half of that (treat the other as child support) and the other into college savings or to keep all towards household expenses. We agreed that we would be helping just as we did with Laura for that and was better to help our own household expenses in the present to be able to do that in the future. It is a HUGE reason she chose in state and college expenses under state expenses, so she would be covered the same as we did Laura without having college debt
	7:03 PM	Jessica:	Reminder, SS statement filled out annually that was sent in showing we kept that
	7:04 PM	Jason:	Yes, I remember those.
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	So if you would like to message her and let her know that we can’t cover that now,be my guest
	7:06 PM	Jason:	The part I don’t recall is needing to pay $600/month (including the $98 already being paid). That wasn’t an expense last year.
	7:07 PM	Jessica:	This year needs paid!
	7:07 PM	Jason:	It seems like poor planning to not budget that at least a year in advance.
	7:07 PM	Jason:	What paid last year?
	7:07 PM	Jessica:	we pulled from the college/insurance savings
	7:08 PM	Jason:	I didn’t realize we pulled $5,000
	7:08 PM	Jessica:	that is no longer there obviously
	7:08 PM	Jessica:	yes, I think about 4500
	7:08 PM	Jason:	It seems like this would have been something to discuss in March when you left
	7:08 PM	Jessica:	Wire fees and if paying in installments more interest
	7:11 PM	Jason:	Okay. Obviously am not going to have Kayla’s school get messed up. Definitely don’t want her to even think twice about it.
	7:11 PM	Jessica:	She was asked to apply for a scholarship this year because of her grades. Won’t qualify this year because she needs to do something being involved with the school. She has changed her whole work schedule to get the scholarship next year
	7:11 PM	Jason:	Yeah, when searching a minute ago I found that message from April
	7:11 PM	Jessica:	so working less
	7:12 PM	Jason:	By my math, you’ll still be okay since if I pay half (or more) of that, the child support for Brenna will more than make up the other. Not ideal, but just the numbers ...
	7:13 PM	Jessica:	Let me refer you back to the above statement:
	7:14 PM	Jessica:	Sure crazy rent on my income and nothing to put towards owning anything. You’re so smart
	7:14 PM	Jason:	I’m referring to this statement of yours “So that’s another 500,  10 months of the year." That may be handled.
	7:15 PM	Jason:	I wouldn’t go for crazy rent. A townhouse or condo, that you can build equity in, might be ideal, and fun.
	7:16 PM	Jessica:	You also want to keep adding my “potential bonuses” those aren’t a given and only get larger towards the end of the year if I make them. So in monthly planning, I can’t plan on that
	7:17 PM	Jason:	Sure. But they’re part of the Guideline Income used to calculate child support.
	7:20 PM	Jason:	This will probably make you mad, but also as a matter of just numbers, your dining out expense per month over the last three months is almost enough to cover the mortgage here. You have more money than you may realize.
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	You’re right you are just going to make me mad. One you don’t know the why of some of those, and honestly none of your business. I could say plenty about your expenses but who cares. What’s important to me is not important to you and visa versa. You spend on things, I prefer time with people, we’re different that way
	7:25 PM	Jason:	Totally agree. How you derive joy from your finances is completely up to you. Now it’s time for one of my joys: helping Brenna with some math.
	7:27 PM	Jessica:	She called on wanting to celebrate tomorrow, maybe start tempering down her expectations as I tried to do
	7:27 PM	Jason:	Sure. We can climb the pyramid ourselves if you’re afraid.
	7:28 PM	Jason:	One quick thought: if you have a statement showing the house was deeded to us together, that of course changes the calculation and I need to give a copy to my attorney. I only mention it because I seem to remember you making remarks that way but I haven’t seen anything.
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	Yes, I do
	7:39 PM	Jason:	Okay, can you forward it?
	7:47 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure it will be included in the discovery
	7:50 PM	Jason:	That’s completely unhelpful and an unecessary expense if you have such a thing. Can you forward it?
	7:51 PM	Jason:	If there is a deed transfer then the calculation is simple. Why would you want to play games about it?
	7:53 PM	Jason:	Did you take a financial document from the cabinet upstairs?
	7:58 PM	Jason:	I shared a PDF with all mortgage statements with you. It’s everything I’ve found. If you have something more, I believe it’s your duty to share.
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	I’m not playing games nor have I taken a single document from upstairs, only made copies. Quite honestly at this point considering how I’ve been treated by your lawyer and you, I’m not doing anything else until I speak with mine. All documents are obviously shared in discovery or if they/we agree with our permission  beforehand. I’m not withholding anything as you did removing me from tax documents etc, but I’m really done giving without councel when it’s been made clear the direction your attorney wants to take things. Remember, I’m living in an echo chamber anyway and obviously an idiot so why worry
	8:44 PM	Jason:	You’re declining to give me access to financial documents you claim to have?
	8:46 PM	Jessica:	That’s not what I said
	8:47 PM	Jessica:	Also, you have the same access
	8:47 PM	Jessica:	Actually more as you didn’t give me full access to all the banking including mortgage
	8:48 PM	Jason:	Okay, either it’s in the documents I just shared or you have something else. Why are you being coy?
	9:00 PM	Jessica:	Hardly being coy. Just really tired of this. You keep controlling access, documents etc until I argue or fight to get them and you dole them out to me. I went into this with two requests with my lawyer. Fair and amicable as possible. I want us to both be able to start over with Brenna being the main focus and us being able to do what’s best for her. That has not what was returned. I hoped to communicate with you and keep those two objectives in mind and have been horribly hurt by your response/strategy and it cost me even more financially to resolve. Every time I think we are talking as friends and trying to be amicable I get blindsided. So from here on out, I’m running all decisions through my lawyer. I don’t trust you or yours quite simply.
	9:03 PM	Jason:	You have radical misperceptions. I guess I’ll just report that you have joint financial documents you decline to provide access to.
	9:12 PM	Jessica:	Have fun with that, as I said you have more access than me (you have me blocked from access). I’m not being combative and unwilling to share...when I speak with my lawyer and understand what I must give you when you request by chat and what is part of discovery is a reasonable thing. I’m not sure what you mean by radical, I didn’t take you off of access to mortgage etc or tax folders as you did making it difficult when I needed to upload things. I didn’t go into this as a fault divorce and make you spend crazy amounts of time and money to address. I didn’t send some crazy proposal that was at the very least insulting
	9:14 PM	Jessica:	I think what is a radical misconception at this point would be be continually blindly accepting what you or your lawyer throw at me as truth
	9:15 PM	Jason:	Seems vindictive to not share documents you imply are determinative. The only outcome is to enrich attorneys and then have to disclose it anyway.
	9:22 PM	Jessica:	Why are we still arguing this? You obviously have documents that haven’t been shared as your lawyer I’m sure instructed, only submitted ones required, which I received. That’s evidenced by the fact that you just now shared this file with me. So to be clear, you can pick and choose what to submit, make the claims you want, withhold what you want,  but if I say I want to speak with my attorney to verify how to best submit a document I’m “withholding” ? Do you even realize how hypocritical you sound?
	9:23 PM	Jason:	No. I’ve not been instructed to withhold anything. Why would I? That’s stupid, just gives the attorneys money. That’s why I find your attitude baffling.
	9:38 PM	Jessica:	By “withholding”  I mean that not everything we uploaded as evidence for us goes into the mandatory disclosures. They submit the basic required documents. Past that they reserve for discovery if needed. Always find it interesting how many things in my responses you don’t address by the way
	9:40 PM	Jessica:	I’m exhausted. I’ve been studying like crazy to keep my job. I was hoping to have this one night be good. I’m going to bed.
	9:40 PM	Jason:	I’m focusing on the elements that facilitate resolution, not contending with misapprehensions
	9:41 PM	Jessica:	Okay Jason
	9:41 PM	Jason:	Sleep well. Good luck resolving exempt status.
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	So if I said I have this document that changes all your numbers, that would make you do that, as opposed to who cares...what’s the right thing to do? This... This is why we are where we are. Not everything is a number or formula,     you have people in your life. Treat them as people.
	9:48 PM	Jessica:	Don’t tell me sleep well when you’re actions do the opposite
	9:50 PM	Jason:	Of course. But finances absolutely are numbers. That’s where we at least have to start.
	9:53 PM	Jessica:	You cement over and over for me why this marriage is over. Sadly I don’t think you can even understand that, I hope someday you do

Thursday, September 27, 2018

	8:40 AM	Jessica:	He’s absent first yesterday and today again?
	8:42 AM	Jason:	I got him up this morning in time. I can get him up earlier still. Or, better yet, he can use one of the several alarms we’ve bought. I’ll set one for him.
	8:42 AM	Jessica:	He’s not just tardy, he’s not even going
	8:43 AM	Jason:	In that case, I don’t know what he’s doing. I’ve seen him up with my eyes every day this week.
	8:44 AM	Jason:	The surprise debris on couch and kitchen tell me he’s been up through the night. I’ve disabled Netflix and Chromecast except for 5-11pm.
	8:44 AM	Jason:	As of Monday.
	8:45 AM	Jason:	As best I can tell, he’s been eating loafs of bread and drinking creamer, maybe dunking it.
	8:45 AM	Jason:	I wouldn’t excuse the absences
	8:48 AM	Jason:	Oh, I see your e-mail now. I’ll get a clock set up for him. I don’t want to sound mean but it isn’t my first instinct to treat him as helpless. I’ve told him a few times that I’m glad to make him waffles or whatever if he gets up in time. He doesn’t bother.
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	Agreed he’s not helpless but would like him to graduate. I make him get up, obviously I take him so I know he’s going. Telling him to get up and making sure he leaves the house helpful
	8:57 AM	Jason:	I guess he was okay at getting up when he had a phone since it’s only the last couple weeks I’ve been getting him up. I’ll put one of the alarm clocks up there.
	9:01 AM	Jason:	He’s been more interactive with family lately, hanging out downstairs with us. I guess because he has no secret phone. So I’d hoped getting up would be early. He went upstairs at 9:40 last night saying how tired he was after our scary movie and popcorn.
	9:01 AM	Jason:	*would be easier
	9:01 AM	Jason:	Anyway, alarm clock ho’
	9:03 AM	Jessica:	If you could corner him on why he’s missed 1st period all week
	9:06 AM	Jason:	Yeah, will do
	9:06 AM	Jason:	Planning JUMP pyramid climbing contest again tonight. I’ll have him come along.
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	Can you bring Hunter insurance card tomorrow?
	3:00 PM	Jason:	yep
	3:00 PM	Jason:	wouldn’t hurt to remind me again later but i’ll make a keep doc for myself
	3:01 PM	Jason:	where should I look for the card?
	3:02 PM	Jason:	nevermind on reminder, i put an alarm on the keep note
	3:15 PM	Jessica:	Not sure where, it came to you when we switch I them over from mine to yours
	3:15 PM	Jason:	okay, i’ll look
	6:44 PM	Jason:	Maybe give Brenna a msg. She’s home while hunter and I have sushi algebra.
	6:45 PM	Jason:	Because still grounded
	6:45 PM	Jason:	She was upset
	6:45 PM	Jessica:	Oh, gotcha
	6:46 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully he actually turns in whatever work is supposedly getting done. He has 24 missing assignments
	6:46 PM	Jason:	He brought two
	7:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:20 PM	Jason:	Loves trig
	7:22 PM	Jason:	He gets to use the same calculator I used when I was his age doing this same stuff!
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	Looks thrilled
	7:32 PM	Jessica:	Brenna still mad
	7:40 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:40 PM	Jason:	Same battery as in high school
	8:30 PM	Jason:	Has alarm clock set now. Would only say “alrighty” about missing first period. Not sure how that explains anything. Assured me the alarm clock would get him to school on time. And of course I’ll still go up there in the morning.
	8:31 PM	Jessica:	Okay thanks. Get assignments done?
	9:08 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	9:09 PM	Jessica:	We should start stapling to his clothes, maybe would turn in

Friday, September 28, 2018

	8:29 AM	Jessica:	I’ll move $300 to your account and just don’t distribute to me and that will be 600 to pay off the rest of her competition fees, does that work? Stupid crazy taxes, I double bonused. I should have told them to do one on this check and the other on next 😂
	8:40 AM	Jason:	that works fine. thanks. Hunter was off to school early this morning.
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	shocking
	8:50 AM	Jessica:	I’m a bit worried about doing his hearing test today, wondering if I should have it rescheduled to first in the morning to make sure he sleeps with ear plugs and goes straight in
	8:50 AM	Jason:	that seems wise
	8:50 AM	Jason:	what time today was the test scheduled?
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	4:15
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	worried that wasn’t smart.
	8:54 AM	Jason:	not really sure. since he doesn’t have a phone, i don’t see him with headphones anymore
	8:54 AM	Jason:	i heard music from his room last night but sounded like he was may using the clock radio for it
	8:54 AM	Jason:	*maybe
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, not supposed to have any sound, use earplugs. I’ll call and see if there is something early this week they can do and go from there
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	I assume I’m picking up from gymnastics tonight?
	8:57 AM	Jason:	on gymnastics -- last I heard but you know how that is
	8:58 AM	Jessica:	good point
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	8:45 monday
	12:18 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:18 PM	Jason:	if he’s in my charge, I’ll see to it that he wears earplugs
	12:18 PM	Jason:	making reminder to self now
	12:19 PM	Jessica:	Ok awesome. I saw the scores and they were bad. If he wants a better chance of passing then he needs to not put head phones on or listen to loud music for the next three days
	12:19 PM	Jessica:	From sgnt Parker 10min ago
	12:19 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:20 PM	Jason:	I think the headphones thing may have taken care of itself
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	That’s what I said
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	I’m going to make him wear earplugs the night before until the appt 😂
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	And clean his ears 😂
	12:21 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:21 PM	Jason:	yeah, he barely ever showers let alone clean his ears
	12:21 PM	Jason:	actually, he’s had two jet baths with candles, gotta give him that
	12:22 PM	Jessica:	Clean the tub, you realize what he was doing in there...
	12:22 PM	Jason:	Yeah, he’s the only one who uses it. Brenna always prefers “her” tub.
	12:24 PM	Jessica:	Funny, one of them every night in mine. Rarely use their own bathrooms
	12:24 PM	Jessica:	I clean the tub a lot when they’re here!
	12:24 PM	Jason:	I invite her to use the jet tub or shower every time and she always declines
	12:24 PM	Jason:	She’s usually mad that I’m making her wash instead of continuing to play
	12:25 PM	Jessica:	Same here
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	Well that’s one to go home early😂
	2:28 PM	Jason:	Yeah. Everyone else left. But we’re still on laptops in a meeting.
	4:48 PM	Jason:	Hunter wondering if you’re getting him.
	4:48 PM	Jason:	I said he needs to get his bike home before anything
	4:49 PM	Jason:	It’s been gone for over a week
	4:56 PM	Jessica:	I will be. Agreed get his bike.
	4:56 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:56 PM	Jason:	Let him know of hearing test Monday
	5:10 PM	Jason:	He says he doesn’t know the phone number of whoever it is that he says has the bike
	5:11 PM	Jason:	Maybe I’ll say he can sell his watch, see how that goes ...
	5:14 PM	Jason:	could you get a number off his phone if that’s where it is?
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	I can try
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	Not home currently.
	5:16 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:17 PM	Jason:	says he doesn’t have number there either
	5:18 PM	Jason:	they only talk by snapchat
	5:19 PM	Jessica:	That actually is probably true
	6:37 PM	Jessica:	He was tardy to first today, not sure want he was doing this morning leaving early
	6:37 PM	Jason:	yeah, what the heck
	6:37 PM	Jason:	he was gone by 7:30
	6:38 PM	Jason:	one clue may be that i asked him how he used a full bottle of creamer this week without making coffee and he said he brings it to school to add to coffee he gets from teacher lounge
	6:38 PM	Jason:	i bought a new bottle only because i use it so rarely the last one was suspect
	6:38 PM	Jason:	anyway, lounging is a factor
	6:40 PM	Jessica:	Not sure how I’m physically or emotionally going to deal with him this week. Nothing left and not a good couple days. Sad, but I’m not looking forward to dealing with him
	6:40 PM	Jason:	He can always stay here
	6:40 PM	Jessica:	Also need to call Scott back. Should prepare him for loving there soon
	6:40 PM	Jason:	Freudian slip
	6:40 PM	Jessica:	Living
	6:41 PM	Jessica:	Funny
	6:41 PM	Jason:	I think Hunter is asking about you picking him up only because I locked TV down
	6:41 PM	Jason:	5-11PM only
	6:42 PM	Jessica:	Had two cysts rupture so my tolerance level is negative 100. He won’t being watching anything here
	6:43 PM	Jason:	Oh damn. Don’t feel like you need to get him. He’s been wanting to watch Solo. Maybe I’ll see if I can grab it.
	6:43 PM	Jason:	Star Wars --- I didn’t know what he was talking about it first so there you go
	6:44 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, he’s been asking but I’ve been saying no because of his actions
	6:44 PM	Jason:	Right, not taking him anywhere
	6:45 PM	Jessica:	Just tried to do a celebration dinner at tavern with friends and had to leave because still in too much pain.
	6:45 PM	Jason:	Lame
	6:45 PM	Jason:	I’m sure they’ll give you another
	6:46 PM	Jason:	I assume Deborah called you about Andrew picking up
	6:46 PM	Jason:	She kept cutting out while talking to me so wasn’t sure of the plan
	6:46 PM	Jessica:	Yes, supposed to let me know by 7:45 if happening or if I’m getting
	6:47 PM	Jason:	Oh good, last minute 😒
	6:47 PM	Jessica:	As usual
	6:47 PM	Jason:	If it hurts to drive, let me know, I can do it
	6:48 PM	Jessica:	I’ll let you know. Just glued to my heating pad currently
	6:48 PM	Jessica:	On the bright side I wasn’t getting sick 😂 also happened AFTER my test
	6:49 PM	Jason:	Yeah, that’s a very good thing
	6:59 PM	Jason:	going over to buy baileys to replace creamer. don’t have to refrigerate that so can hide it.
	7:00 PM	Jessica:	😂
	7:01 PM	Jessica:	On the plus side I have a full dinner for Brenna to eat when she gets here. No cooking
	7:03 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:03 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	7:04 PM	Jessica:	Pretty
	8:06 PM	Jessica:	Holy crap can you get them? She was supposed to message me by 7:45 if Andrew wasn’t and just now said she hasn’t heard from him. I assumed he was so just took pain medicine
	8:06 PM	Jason:	Yep, heading out
	8:06 PM	Jessica:	Thank you!!! I’m so sorry. I should have known better
	8:07 PM	Jessica:	Was just waiting all day to take something until I knew
	8:07 PM	Jessica:	I’ll pick up a drive on your week
	8:08 PM	Jessica:	Seriously, minutes before they need picked up???
	8:10 PM	Jessica:	Thank God they’re always late getting out
	8:12 PM	Jessica:	I may have just not been nice in my response to Deborah
	8:20 PM	Jessica:	Done. We will figure it out
	8:22 PM	Jason:	I’m here and they’re just getting done
	8:22 PM	Jessica:	Sorry I thought you were getting her tonight my bad
	8:23 PM	Jessica:	Except you told me he was and would tell me by 7:45 if not.
	8:23 PM	Jessica:	Minutes before pick up really frustrating
	8:23 PM	Jessica:	Especially after missed pick ups, cancellations and Piper not going last minute. I think we will just figure it out from here. I need to count on her going and that agreed upon rides are covered. I can’t just give up Saturdays for make up because she missed due to Piper’s schedule and communication
	8:24 PM	Jessica:	Those are my messages
	8:24 PM	Jessica:	Except the first
	8:25 PM	Jason:	Asking for sleepover at Piper’s
	8:25 PM	Jessica:	No!
	8:26 PM	Jessica:	Also I’m sure that wasn’t arranged
	8:26 PM	Jessica:	She wants to play with Delaney tomorrow, she can do that
	8:26 PM	Jessica:	I’m furious
	9:09 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:09 PM	Jason:	You need
	9:30 PM	Jessica:	There was 10 minutes before this and she’s still going....
	9:31 PM	Jason:	Telling you about the girl group at school this week?
	9:31 PM	Jessica:	The video is 12 minutes
	9:32 PM	Jason:	Oh
	9:32 PM	Jessica:	Can’t upload that big
	9:33 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a video.
	9:34 PM	Jason:	Yeah I heard the same long spiel
	9:34 PM	Jason:	Really on her mind
	9:39 PM	Jessica:	Still going.... other things
	9:42 PM	Jessica:	My pain meds aren’t enough
	9:43 PM	Jason:	I thought she might have blown that steam off while we drive
	9:43 PM	Jason:	Drove
	9:49 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	9:49 PM	Jessica:	Not at all
	9:50 PM	Jessica:	Make it stop
	9:51 PM	Jason:	Put some food in its mouth?
	9:51 PM	Jessica:	Did, didn’t work
	9:51 PM	Jessica:	Energizer Bunny
	9:52 PM	Jason:	Cough syrup?
	9:52 PM	Jessica:	Seriously, not a breath since she arrived
	9:53 PM	Jessica:	We have officially hit preteen mode
	9:53 PM	Jason:	Hooray
	10:01 PM	Jessica:	Onto the new book and way more details than I need. I’m never going to bed
	10:03 PM	Jason:	Good luck
	10:03 PM	Jason:	I’m heading to bed, actually
	10:03 PM	Jessica:	I hate you
	10:04 PM	Jessica:	I’m taking back my drive offer.. You should have warned me we stepped into overdrive preteen mode
	10:05 PM	Jessica:	My brain is dead
	10:05 PM	Jason:	Sorry, couldn’t get to my phone in time
	10:06 PM	Jessica:	I might even drink the whiskey here if this continues
	10:06 PM	Jason:	She was being quiet after dropping piper so I asked if something made her unhappy today and it was unleashed
	10:07 PM	Jessica:	Oh.. That was 30 minutes ago...way moved on
	10:52 PM	Jessica:	Did she get crack somehow? She’s still going

Saturday, September 29, 2018

	8:54 AM	Jessica:	What device did Hunter find now?
	10:16 AM	Jason:	His laptop. He plugged it directly into the network at the router.
	10:18 AM	Jessica:	Aq
	10:19 AM	Jason:	aq you too
	10:20 AM	Jessica:	Oops 😂
	10:20 AM	Jason:	Actually, looking more closely, he doesn’t have a port for direct connection so must have used that feature where you can press a button on the router itself to temporarily gain access.
	10:27 AM	Jessica:	Holy crap, that was a lot of thinking for him
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	I’ll get him in a couple hours. Promised Brenna pedicures if I bonused
	10:30 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:36 AM	Jason:	no e-mail yet about pirated movies
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	That’s something at least
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	Give it a day 😁
	10:40 AM	Jason:	Yeah. I’ve blocked connecting that way from working again. He’s always free to walk over to coffee shops or something and use their WiFi. Not sure why he doesn’t.
	10:43 AM	Jason:	Funny thing is he left his laptop sitting by router, everything all akimble.
	10:43 AM	Jason:	For someone who predicates his life on deception, he’s really terrible at it.
	10:43 AM	Jason:	As we’ve observed before, it would actually be less effort for him to do the right things. :)
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	That’s what baffles me
	10:44 AM	Jason:	Let me know when you’re nearing departure and I’ll get Hunter up
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	11:40 AM	Jessica:	Brenna thinks she’s most “Americano” in discussions about geneology
	11:45 AM	Jason:	Feeling better today?
	11:47 AM	Jessica:	Yes, still sore but not doubled over living with a heating pad
	11:47 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:48 AM	Jason:	Wow. luxury. I didn’t know.
	11:49 AM	Jessica:	Massage and all
	11:49 AM	Jason:	and WiFi?
	11:50 AM	Jessica:	Yes, she did that first thing
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	Once she’s done will run by to grab Hunter
	1:04 PM	Jessica:	Mood polish😂
	1:04 PM	Jason:	Oh boy
	1:04 PM	Jason:	I got Hunter up already. He didn’t actually get out of bed, though.
	1:04 PM	Jason:	If you find a moment to help him snapchat (assuming it’s not total fiction) the buddy with his bike, that would be cool
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	Will do
	1:09 PM	Jason:	I shouldn’t be but am still surprised how disrespectful he’s been about it. Buy him a new bike and shows no care about it at all.
	1:11 PM	Jessica:	In absolutely furious about it. Not surprised but furious. I’m just quite honestly done. I have nothing left. He’s going to have to learn by severe consequences and no support
	1:12 PM	Jessica:	Need to see what I can return the phone for. If it will cover most then will. If not will give to Brenna or Kayla
	1:29 PM	Jason:	I’ll help pay if going to kids since Hunter obviously isn’t paying his part
	4:32 PM	Jason:	Heather asking about her registration. I could swear you picked that up.
	4:34 PM	Jessica:	No I had you open it when we thought maybe my license. I’ll check to see if I ended up with it but think it’s there still.
	4:34 PM	Jason:	There’s no mail still here. I’ll look around, see if Brenna helped file something.
	4:35 PM	Jessica:	Yeah we had that problem here. Brenna cleaning/filing

Sunday, September 30, 2018

	9:52 AM	Jessica:	Hunter supposedly getting bike today
	10:15 AM	Jason:	yea
	10:21 AM	Jessica:	Now to wake him up and deal with him sneaking out
	10:30 AM	Jason:	oh jeez
	10:31 AM	Jason:	he just never gets how much of his future is on the line, more and more, as he gets older, with these choices
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	Yep, of course tried to lie about it. Not worth my time to argue, just said bs
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	He forgets Dana works late so actually watched him sneak in at 1:30
	10:37 AM	Jason:	I know, I know. I’m often on the verge of asking him about something and realize the answer I get won’t actually give me any information.
	10:38 AM	Jason:	That kid ...
	10:38 AM	Jason:	Good heart, wayward brain
	10:39 AM	Jessica:	Taking girls to circustrix. Hiding all remotes, all devices. Have Shakespeare tonight so guess he will sit here doing nothing
	10:39 AM	Jason:	Oh cool (for the events). I’m sure Hunter will do homework.
	10:39 AM	Jason:	Brenna going to Shakespeare?
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	No, Nancy and I. I was supposed to last Sunday but was too stressed about needing to study for test so rescheduled. It’s closing night so last chance
	10:42 AM	Jessica:	Which looks like will be cold
	10:42 AM	Jason:	Oh good. Hopefully pleasant evening. I asked because Brenna and I talked a few times about going.
	10:43 AM	Jason:	Blankets and hot liquor drinks
	10:43 AM	Jason:	tom and jery
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, just barely snagged hill seats because sold out
	10:43 AM	Jessica:	Good idea!
	10:44 AM	Jason:	inch-and-a-half in the little tub here
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	He’s sitting on the couch reading
	10:44 AM	Jason:	and a gallon of baileys :)
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	Have to get home 😂
	10:44 AM	Jason:	yeah, he’s been reading a lot
	10:44 AM	Jason:	glad he does that, good for brain
	10:45 AM	Jason:	i’m sure he has you to thank
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	Just no homework
	10:45 AM	Jason:	well yeah
	10:45 AM	Jessica:	Anything to not do homework
	10:45 AM	Jason:	he REALLY didn’t want to do some of the math that required a few steps per problem. couldn’t do in head.
	10:45 AM	Jason:	actually didn’t confirm he did it
	10:45 AM	Jason:	graphing equations, describing where they cross axis, etc.
	10:46 AM	Jason:	easy but each problem woudl take ten minutes
	10:46 AM	Jessica:	Still all the missing assignments so most likely not
	10:46 AM	Jason:	kept saying he didn’t get it
	10:46 AM	Jason:	nothing to “get” just do
	10:46 AM	Jessica:	But has 2 classes to get help
	10:47 AM	Jason:	right, i asked if he was getting help in 7th
	10:47 AM	Jason:	he said “yeah” which means nothing
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	Need to grab earplugs
	10:47 AM	Jason:	i have some if you want the t/j
	10:47 AM	Jason:	\new ones
	10:47 AM	Jason:	cheap to get anywhere though
	10:47 AM	Jessica:	Not sure about these hoops are even worth it
	10:48 AM	Jason:	?
	10:49 AM	Jessica:	Hearing test etc, trying to get him in. Still has to graduate
	10:49 AM	Jason:	ah, the hoops you’re jumping through
	10:50 AM	Jason:	you want to feel like you did everything possible
	10:50 AM	Jason:	didn’t mean that to sound self-serving. i mean as a parent, want to do all that’s possible
	10:50 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, looking bleak
	10:51 AM	Jason:	i know scott isn’t highly motivated but he wasn’t this bad, i assume
	10:55 AM	Jessica:	Well.....
	11:10 AM	Jessica:	All kinds of attitude
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	11:33 AM	Jessica:	Blurry
	11:48 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	12:03 PM	Jason:	Was getting haircut
	12:06 PM	Jason:	Tried sport clips
	12:06 PM	Jason:	Seemed kind of dumb
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	It is
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	I can still do flips 😂
	12:28 PM	Jason:	let’s see the video
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a video.

	1:52 PM	Jason:	yet no video
	2:12 PM	Jessica:	Brenna will vouch for me. I did front and back. It wasn’t pretty but successful
	2:14 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	2:40 PM	Jessica:	Do you mind if I run by and grab one of the short chairs and my wine/cheese carrier?
	2:40 PM	Jason:	sounds swell
	2:41 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:21 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:22 PM	Jason:	makes as much mess as kids
	3:26 PM	Jason:	south of airport where you went for lucas cat? (just looking up location/hours)
	3:26 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	3:27 PM	Jason:	looks like timing would be perfect on one of the days i bring to gymnastics. they say check in by 4:30 for vet services.
	3:28 PM	Jason:	$45
	3:28 PM	Jessica:	Okay

	3:28 PM	Jessica:	Hunter said his bike locked up at Albertsons on federal way
	3:32 PM	Jason:	with HIS lock or someone else’s?
	3:32 PM	Jason:	i guess i can bring bolt cutters if not his
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	His
	3:32 PM	Jason:	okay, i’ll run and get it. hopefully not b.s.
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	1225
	3:32 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	3:33 PM	Jason:	leaving before i finish this beer
	3:45 PM	Jason:	Coat of dust, flat tire
	3:45 PM	Jason:	I think it’s been here the whole time
	3:46 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, when I tried to nail him down on address he said his friend left it there... Which tells me he did days ago
	3:47 PM	Jessica:	Hunter that is most likely
	3:52 PM	Jason:	Afire in hills?
	3:55 PM	Jessica:	?
	3:55 PM	Jason:	Yeah, pretty sure there was never a friend borrowing the bike and his lock
	3:55 PM	Jason:	heavy smoke in hills
	3:56 PM	Jason:	wonder what his plan was: just leave the bike there forever?
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	Probably, lock it up
	4:04 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

	4:42 PM	Jason:	ah, thanks. I was refreshing their page but not seeing it yet.
	9:49 PM	Jessica:	Brenna walking to your house after school and I will get her. She doesn’t want to bike in the morning and Dana working at 3 tomorrow so will drop her at school. Also, after being asked several times before going there... She forgot scratchy
	10:26 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:27 PM	Jason:	Funny, I teased her about having scratchy earlier but was only joking. I hadn’t seen it.
	10:27 PM	Jason:	Good play?
	10:33 PM	Jessica:	Sooo good
	10:35 PM	Jason:	You sent a sticker.
	10:37 PM	Jessica:	Time to soak, muscles sore😂
	10:39 PM	Jason:	Hope you can walk tomorrow

	8:30 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	8:31 AM	Jessica:	Looks like that’s the math she’s struggling with
	8:40 AM	Jason:	Uh oh. That turkey. We worked on double digit multiplication, not decimal placement.
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	Hunter pouting because after three different tries and excuses to “need” his phone I wouldn’t give it to him. Hope he doesn’t sabotage this test
	8:42 AM	Jason:	Still sharing stories here about how Hunter used my high school calculator, how awesome it was, how not-awesome Hunter thought it was
	8:42 AM	Jason:	yeah, he may heed calculator but they have those at school
	8:42 AM	Jason:	like i said yesterday, his version of “i don’t understand” just means he doesn’t understand how he can do something in one step
	8:43 AM	Jessica:	I mean his hearing test
	8:43 AM	Jason:	i know. Obviously no reason he needs a phone for that.
	8:44 AM	Jason:	Sleep test to be scheduled depending on this test?
	8:44 AM	Jessica:	Yep
	8:56 AM	Jessica:	Ohh, I’m about to go postal
	9:08 AM	Jason:	Uh oh. On Hunter. Or on administrative people.
	9:20 AM	Jessica:	Receptionists
	9:21 AM	Jessica:	After an hour, that don’t actually do hearing tests there
	9:22 AM	Jessica:	Darcy managed to get us in at 11:30 upstairs with hearing specialist. I was not happy and as we were going to car she ran out and they got us in 9:30
	9:23 AM	Jason:	oh good lord
	9:23 AM	Jason:	I can imagine the tone you had to use
	9:24 AM	Jessica:	Oh... I used it
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	Let them know they need to so some training with receptionists. Since I called not once but twice and was clear what we needed and why
	9:26 AM	Jason:	basic stuff
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:34 AM	Jessica:	Fingers crossed
	9:34 AM	Jason:	yep
	9:34 AM	Jason:	looks excited
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	In a much better mood so hopefully... ears cleaned and she checked they looked fine
	9:38 AM	Jessica:	Thank God coffee place in lobby
	10:07 AM	Jessica:	Didn’t look so good
	10:08 AM	Jason:	do we have any idea what threshold is waiverable?
	10:11 AM	Jessica:	Similar results. Permanent hearing loss in right ear
	10:12 AM	Jason:	Too much to waiver? Or do you know? We knew there was some hearing loss ...
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	Not sure yet. Get report by tomorrow but they didn’t really give doctor criteria for what they wanted
	10:41 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:36 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:37 PM	Jason:	media here. we were told to clean our desks.
	12:37 PM	Jason:	this is clean
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	1:25 PM	Jason:	not sure what media they were. seemed to be doing a piece on the arrangement of stuff
	1:26 PM	Jason:	we got the note to clean and none of us did anything
	1:33 PM	Jessica:	oh boy
	2:02 PM	Jason:	sort of obvious https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-teen-behavior-9938/
	2:03 PM	Jason:	of course, gotta say the old “correlation is not causation” -- could mean youth already predisposed to misbehavior sleep less, not vice versa
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	agreed
	2:09 PM	Jessica:	he does get the sleep, just not when he’s supposed to !
	2:09 PM	Jason:	right
	2:49 PM	Jessica:	are you okay if I get the kids a bit after 5:30? Going to try and shave 30 minutes off the 3 hours I missed this morning and work late a few times this week. Have some scheduled appts so a bit tricky to do on lunches
	2:50 PM	Jason:	Yep, that’s fine. Already hid food they would make a mess with (peanut butter, some pita chips).
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	smart
	2:51 PM	Jason:	left over spaghetti and stir fry but of course they won’t touch that
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	nope
	4:24 PM	Jason:	when i told brenna i’d quiz her on decimals “Ugh
Fine”
	4:26 PM	Jessica:	yeah, better you than me
	5:46 PM	Jessica:	Just wrapped up calls with doctors, heading over shortly. After I find my flip flops 😂
	6:08 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:09 PM	Jason:	We just finished soccer
	7:19 PM	Jessica:	Is escape room 2pm?
	7:34 PM	Jason:	Yeah. I think I forwarded receipt to you.
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	Okay, trying figure out cake location
	8:44 PM	Jason:	Do they have space there?
	8:44 PM	Jason:	Brenna needs math help after bath
	8:44 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	8:44 PM	Jessica:	Okay....
	8:45 PM	Jason:	Hmm. Closest restaurant?
	8:45 PM	Jason:	Something in outlet mall?
	8:48 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, something close we can easily do before or after
	8:59 PM	Jason:	Brenna phone died while I was helping her with math
	8:59 PM	Jason:	Could we use yours?
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Yep
	9:01 PM	Jessica:	Having her brush her teeth first
	9:01 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Tuesday, October 2, 2018

	8:27 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:27 AM	Jason:	Sports at work
	8:27 AM	Jason:	😒
	8:57 AM	Jessica:	haha, now you can get into football
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	looking like a no go still for hearing waiver
	9:06 AM	Jason:	damn
	9:06 AM	Jason:	good thing he’s redoubled his scholastic efforts
	9:06 AM	Jason:	sorry, that’s the coffee talking
	9:09 AM	Jessica:	still going to make a couple calls on the airforce side and see but.....
	9:09 AM	Jason:	still crossing fingers
	9:09 AM	Jason:	god, just wish something could be figured out
	9:09 AM	Jason:	he has such potential
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	yes, so frustrating. he has to start WANTING to do something though
	9:14 AM	Jason:	that’s been the key all along
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	Sick to my stomach with what path he’s about to go down, out of ideas
	9:19 AM	Jason:	i know :(
	9:19 AM	Jason:	but he can know we’re always here to lend a hand when he’s ready to make an effort
	9:19 AM	Jason:	just can’t always lend hand for no effort
	9:20 AM	Jason:	it’s hard
	9:24 AM	Jessica:	yeah :(
	9:25 AM	Jessica:	on a side note would you be able to take Brenna tomorrow to gymnastics? Our office is being shutdown for the new install so they are making the staff work in the Nampa office
	9:25 AM	Jason:	sure
	9:26 AM	Jason:	i’ll bring cat too then
	9:26 AM	Jason:	brenna was worried when she saw cat carrier out
	9:26 AM	Jessica:	ohhhh, after the guinea pig I can see why
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	forwarded a couple emails
	10:41 AM	Jessica:	He has Saturday school and skipped 2nd period last Friday
	10:51 AM	Jason:	just seeing those
	10:53 AM	Jason:	can never imagine what he’s thinking when he does these things
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	As he’s telling me, he doesn’t care
	10:54 AM	Jason:	any talk with scott about him going there?
	10:57 AM	Jessica:	yep, I talked to him last night, let him know where things are and that In December if he is flunking out Hunter will be on his own and has been told he will have to go there. Scott not pleased with him either. Asked about him coming in October over one of the 3 day weekends, said do whatever, don’t think it matters at this point.
	10:59 AM	Jason:	:(
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	on iwth airforce
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	with
	11:07 AM	Jessica:	one more hail mary to try
	11:10 AM	Jason:	can’t find right emoji
	11:11 AM	Jessica:	still doesn’t look good but he said worth a try, one thing going for him is IDYCA. They are going to try and submit higher up the chain with a memorandum written up to take a second look because I guess IDCYA graduates are tracked at a very high level and it’s a BIG deal to have them enlist.
	12:17 PM	Jason:	hope, hope
	12:22 PM	Jessica:	yeah...I don’t know that I’m even hoping anymore, but I will at least be able to say I tried EVERYTHING
	12:23 PM	Jason:	definitely
	12:23 PM	Jessica:	put some of the no school days on the trailimage calendar for October
	12:24 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:53 PM	Jason:	https://theoutline.com/post/6323/if-men-had-to-get-iuds-theyd-get-epidurals-and-a-hospital-stay?zd=1&zi=rjsiiz57
	1:04 PM	Jessica:	😂
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	So very true!
	2:45 PM	Jason:	I think I may do a meetup hike after work. Not sure what hunters plan is.
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	he should be going to the house since he stays Tuesday because of late school.
	2:57 PM	Jason:	oh, okay
	2:57 PM	Jason:	he didn’t figure out yesterday that the Netflix starts working again at 5:00 so he watched the ion channel (whatever that is) the whole time
	2:58 PM	Jessica:	😂
	2:58 PM	Jason:	soap opera type shows is all i saw
	2:59 PM	Jason:	anything but homework
	2:59 PM	Jessica:	of course
	3:00 PM	Jason:	well, i may not get home until 8:00 or so. hopefully he can refrain but leaving dishes and crumbs everywhere.
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	I wouldn’t get my hopes up!
	3:01 PM	Jason:	I know, usually he starts nesting on the couch and is surrounded by plates and crumbs scattered on tables. Hence the mention. :(
	3:03 PM	Jason:	Hiking with Meetup group called “Introverts Who Aren’t Total Hermits”  😀 that other group was hardcore and tried to kill me.
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	best to start slow :)
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	that’s a funny group name
	3:13 PM	Jessica:	Just out of meeting with lawyer, he’s wrapping up numbers the next day or two and then will send over to your lawyer
	3:14 PM	Jason:	Okay. I got a copy of the house title that I sent to my attorney so that’s clarified.
	3:14 PM	Jessica:	he’s be sending these as well
	3:16 PM	Jason:	That’s the file I got
	3:16 PM	Jason:	You sent an attachment.
	3:16 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent an attachment.
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent an attachment.
	3:18 PM	Jason:	those are the documents you couldn’t send?
	3:20 PM	Jason:	Oh, I see. That’s 2009. The current deed was estaablished in 2012.
	3:22 PM	Jessica:	wasn’t a matter of couldn’t/ send, just a matter of wanting to speak with my lawyer
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	for some reason the county didn’t have the recorded deed when we did the HELOC on 9/24/12 but the bank did
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	dang another death claim today, comes in waves
	3:29 PM	Jason:	Maybe the county didn’t have it because that deed of trust pertains to the HELOC, not the house?
	3:29 PM	Jason:	Anyway, thanks for these.
	3:29 PM	Jason:	Good luck with the claim :(
	3:29 PM	Jason:	*the death claim
	3:40 PM	Jessica:	so sad when they’re younger and it’s unexpected
	3:40 PM	Jason:	ah yeah. good they planned, i guess
	3:49 PM	Jason:	oh damn. forgot to order brenna costume. was just waiting for paycheck last time. is large (10-12) the right size? i’ll order now.
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	yep
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	or she’ll hurt you
	3:54 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:54 PM	Jessica:	She isn’t going to gymnastics. Was pretty snotty this morning, Dana just picked her up and she’s more so, ugh
	3:57 PM	Jason:	She just messaged me.
	3:57 PM	Jason:	Costume ordered.
	4:05 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	5:08 PM	Jessica:	Hunter at my house
	5:08 PM	Jason:	Ah
	5:08 PM	Jason:	Somehow still dirty dishes here
	5:08 PM	Jessica:	Your house safe
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Was probably there first
	5:09 PM	Jason:	Yeah, definitely was
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Longboarded to mine
	5:09 PM	Jason:	Decided to come home before hike rather than stay at work extra 1.5 hours
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Smart
	5:09 PM	Jason:	Must have been tired of chanel 9
	5:14 PM	Jason:	Must have also figured out his network connection trick wasn’t working anymore
	8:41 PM	Jessica:	Dropping Hunter early there. I have to be in Nampa by 8
	8:44 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:44 PM	Jason:	Ugh for you
	8:49 PM	Jessica:	Exactly, I’m going to be grouchy
	8:49 PM	Jason:	Dropping Brenna too
	8:49 PM	Jessica:	Good meet up?
	8:49 PM	Jason:	?
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	No, Dana taking her
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	Hike?
	8:50 PM	Jason:	Yeah, pretty good. I think I’m the most talkative
	8:50 PM	Jason:	Yeah, hike
	8:50 PM	Jessica:	No way
	8:50 PM	Jason:	Told about local places, history
	8:51 PM	Jason:	Les bois
	8:52 PM	Jessica:	Ice breaker
	9:37 PM	Jason:	I’ve left the front door unlocked
	9:41 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	10:52 PM	Jason:	This vacation rental company with a Boise office says it’s North America’s biggest now
	10:53 PM	Jason:	Well hell, that’s not what I was trying to share

	8:07 AM	Jessica:	Nice
	8:08 AM	Jessica:	Brenna home sick
	8:36 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:36 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:36 AM	Jason:	oops
	8:36 AM	Jason:	:(
	8:37 AM	Jessica:	I know, feel bad because I have to be in Nampa today
	8:38 AM	Jason:	I could have stayed home with her ... next time. She might prefer a full day on her phone anyway. :)
	8:41 AM	Jessica:	probably 😂
	8:55 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:55 AM	Jason:	New toys
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	oh boy...you may never leave
	9:07 AM	Jason:	i’m getting this stuff figured out. I know how fine it has to be ground, what pressure to watch for as it’s brewing ...
	9:07 AM	Jason:	ready for my starbucks job
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	I was about to say...career change!
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	I didn’t get the emergency alert test message, guess I’m screwed if there is a disaster 😂
	12:32 PM	Jason:	I didn’t get one either. We can always hide out in Terry’s or Eric’s bunkers.
	12:35 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	3:24 PM	Jason:	I don’t think my salad boxes sufficiently absorb afternoon beer
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	sounds like more quinoa needed
	3:25 PM	Jessica:	or brown rice
	3:35 PM	Jason:	that’s why i’ve poured another
	3:35 PM	Jason:	good point
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	another beer?
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	may need to go use your fancy coffee machine before biking😂
	4:35 PM	Jason:	Ironically, centurylink employees in elevator were asking how much beer were allowed to drink
	4:57 PM	Jason:	Hunter here if you want to grab him m
	6:32 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	6:34 PM	Jason:	That was 90 minutes ago. He isn’t here now.
	6:34 PM	Jason:	Said he was going to Starbucks and would be right back but that didn’t happen.
	6:35 PM	Jason:	Also said he would put his dishes away before going anywhere.
	11:38 PM	Jessica:	Yep, even the tiniest bit of shellfish makes me horribly sick. This SUCKS!

Thursday, October 4, 2018

	7:31 AM	Jason:	🙁
	10:20 AM	Jason:	You okay now?
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	yeah, throat feels crappy still, about to try and get some food in me on the way to counceling
	10:42 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:34 AM	Jason:	spaying scheduled for next friday
	11:35 AM	Jason:	awkward when she asked me for cat’s name
	11:35 AM	Jason:	Brenna better today?
	12:04 PM	Jason:	Hunter just showed up
	12:04 PM	Jason:	(oh, I’m home)
	12:20 PM	Jessica:	I was thinking that the other day, wonder what name he’s going to use 😂
	12:21 PM	Jason:	I could only remember the oldest and latest, Squangy and Lucky so I went with Lucky.
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	that’s funny
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	just Cat
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	The Cat
	12:21 PM	Jessica:	She was better, less snotty
	12:22 PM	Jason:	oh good
	12:22 PM	Jessica:	playing hookie? this is the day for it
	12:23 PM	Jessica:	yeah, he currently has 31 missing assignments and looks like skipped 2nd period yesterday and today
	12:23 PM	Jason:	no, I’m working
	12:23 PM	Jason:	but not too hard
	12:23 PM	Jason:	crikey, taking giving up to a new level
	12:26 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, at this point, especially if the airforce thing is a no go which we should know in a couple weeks, he might as well just stay at his dad’s if he is going over end of October
	12:27 PM	Jessica:	Makes me wonder why I am getting up early and taking him to school, he doesn’t do any work and still misses class
	12:27 PM	Jason:	Yeah, fair point. Well, you know the answer: so *you* know you did all you could.
	12:28 PM	Jessica:	and he has Saturday school, reminder
	12:29 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:30 PM	Jason:	I’ll get him there but raises (*not* begs) same question: what’s the point?
	12:31 PM	Jessica:	agreed, not sure what the consequence is for not going, other than punishment of not letting him sleep and having to sit there for a few hours
	12:32 PM	Jason:	I guess there’s not much academic point since he won’t do anything there but a small point in reminding him the world has consequences.
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	yeah
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	ugh
	12:33 PM	Jason:	Kayla tell you Nick got Mustang? Tried to help him find part it needs here.
	12:34 PM	Jason:	... without crazy shipping cost
	12:34 PM	Jessica:	oh yes, I heard as soon as it happened
	12:35 PM	Jason:	red with racing stripes
	12:35 PM	Jason:	305 horse power
	12:36 PM	Jessica:	sounds like you want one too
	12:47 PM	Jessica:	I need to wire Kayla’s payment. Do you want me to take from your account and just deduct my half from next distribution, or I can put half in and then wire from that account?
	12:48 PM	Jessica:	great on phone with councelor and principal
	12:49 PM	Jason:	you can take from my account. i don’t have any expenses planned other than brenna’s birthday.
	12:49 PM	Jason:	Wonder why Hunter came here. On the off weeks, I don’t stock any food they like. I just have salad in there.
	12:53 PM	Jessica:	Probably to vape, he reeked when I picked him up from starbucks
	12:54 PM	Jason:	Oh. I always throw away vape stuff when I find it but I haven’t looked in his room for a while.
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	he’s getting two days in house detentions for skipping class
	12:54 PM	Jason:	so has to stay after school for that?
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	in a few weeks seniors that are not on track to pass get sent info on having them go to Frank Church to get the credits
	12:54 PM	Jessica:	no I think he’s in detention all day at school
	12:55 PM	Jason:	well that won’t help
	12:55 PM	Jessica:	If continues will make it longer or possibly he has days home.
	12:55 PM	Jessica:	He told the principal he doesn’t care about doing the work or going to class
	12:56 PM	Jessica:	gave the same attitude as we get
	12:57 PM	Jason:	do you think Frank Church would do any good? There isn’t much around there, southwest of airport.
	12:58 PM	Jason:	Unless they’re actually like the academy, hard to imagine anything changing his behavior.
	12:58 PM	Jason:	Someone on him 24x7
	12:58 PM	Jessica:	So looking like he can just go to his dads this coming month. I told the principal what his options are and if he’s going to continue not going or doing work which is choosing to drop out, seems pointless to give him at home detention, he can just go
	12:58 PM	Jessica:	no, I’m not wasting my time with Frank Church
	12:59 PM	Jason:	Upsetting
	12:59 PM	Jessica:	He has so much helps, support and extra periods and has put not an ounce of effort in
	12:59 PM	Jason:	Might as well book the flight and get best rate :(
	1:00 PM	Jessica:	yeah, I’ll message Scott and see if he was booking for the last weekend
	1:00 PM	Jason:	Do you have any sense of whether Scott has a plan for him there? To get a job, try for GED, something?
	1:01 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	1:02 PM	Jessica:	Agrees and is angry about his lack of effort and not even trying to graduate. Pretty sure will make him get some kind of job if he eants to stay there
	1:02 PM	Jessica:	wants
	1:02 PM	Jason:	A job he won’t get fired from after a week, hopefully
	1:02 PM	Jessica:	It will be up to Hunter to choose to want to get GED or pay for classes to get credits he needs
	1:03 PM	Jason:	The flight would be at month end?
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	As the principal told him, get is while it’s free or get a job to pay for it later when you realize you can’t do anything without it
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	has 26th off
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	not sure if he was booking though
	1:04 PM	Jason:	So insane. The effort to finish now is so small. And not like he seems to use the “free” time of not trying to do much fun. Sit around.
	1:04 PM	Jason:	It is what it is at this point
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	yeah, I have nothing left, no ideas to try, just starting to accept what’s going to have to happen
	1:09 PM	Jason:	Like I say, we can let him know that we’re always here to give him a hand when we see him try. I’d still help him buy a car, work on stuff, whatever, if he first demonstrates initiative and gets most of the way himself.
	1:09 PM	Jason:	He’ll never be without people ready to assist. He just won’t have people anymore who will do everything on his behalf.
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, hoping the reality check happens quickly...not four years down the road
	1:31 PM	Jessica:	Off the phone with Scott
	1:33 PM	Jason:	Any new thoughts from him?
	1:42 PM	Jessica:	nope, he said he can be sent there whenever decided. Agrees not worth all the detention/frank church stuff as he’s choosing to not do anything. Agrees time for reality check consequences. If he goes there he will have to get a job at gas station or fast food to pay for his own things or be doing whatever needed to get GED. No phone etc. paid for, he’s on his own or he can couch surf and be on his own
	1:43 PM	Jessica:	Scott tried to talk to him the other day and he got the same attitude with him
	1:48 PM	Jason:	Sounds like we have a plan at least
	1:49 PM	Jessica:	sadly, yes
	2:27 PM	Jessica:	Do you want to grab Brenna from School and then I can just grab them both from there after work rather than Dana making a trip over and then me?
	2:28 PM	Jason:	Sure
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	I’ll run by ICCU on the way to do the wire so it’s ready to go out tomorrow.
	2:31 PM	Jessica:	Nov 3rd flight only 80. Think that will be the deadline for Hunter
	2:40 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:53 PM	Jason:	I’ll see if Brenna has those decimal math sheets so we can fix and turn them back in.
	2:54 PM	Jessica:	crap,  I think they got thrown away
	2:54 PM	Jessica:	I’ll check
	2:54 PM	Jason:	you took pictures, maybe that’s enough to see the problem and re-do? or maybe your picture didn’t capture that questions ...
	2:57 PM	Jessica:	yeah, don’t think it got them all, think still on top in garbage though
	2:58 PM	Jason:	okay, not end of world if they can’t be corrected
	2:58 PM	Jason:	she seemed to quickly get it when i explained it and quizzed her verbally
	3:00 PM	Jessica:	good, maybe just needed explained differently
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	Hunter: can i get like 8 dollars to get some food im staying at school to work on my test corrections for math
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	me:
	3:24 PM	Jessica:	😂😂😂😂😂
	3:30 PM	Jason:	pshhh, yeah
	3:32 PM	Jessica:	he still had some on there anyway, just didn’t know it
	3:56 PM	Jessica:	don’t forget the monster
	3:59 PM	Jason:	Think the cat wants to go with hunter?
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	Nice try
	3:59 PM	Jessica:	Brenna would kill you
	4:11 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	4:12 PM	Jessica:	the cat is impressed
	4:29 PM	Jason:	prepare for an evening concert
	4:30 PM	Jessica:	oh boy
	4:48 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Brenna requesting Barbacoa for family birthday dinner
	7:23 PM	Jason:	Okay
	7:24 PM	Jason:	If hunter can refrain from steak and lobster
	7:24 PM	Jessica:	Agreed, just not an option
	7:29 PM	Jessica:	I’ll call for reservation
	7:34 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Friday, October 5, 2018

	8:30 AM	Jessica:	told Hunter this morning he only has a few weeks. He called me when I was almost to work. Wanted to see if you were still at the house, senior photos/paperwork today that he’s had all week, needs filled out
	8:45 AM	Jason:	Of course. No, house is actually locked tight.
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	Sounds good, he’s I’m sure going to do whatever after school for a couple hours anyway. If needed I’m sure they had more there and he could fill out, though seems pointless. I told him it was up to him over the next few weeks, but since he’s not doing ANY schoolwork, skipping class and has made it clear he doesn’t care, he would only be here a few more weeks. Just said okay
	8:48 AM	Jessica:	Brenna went a whole week without scratchy
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Oh wow (scratchy)
	8:54 AM	Jason:	I’ll probably be home a bit early today so he shouldn’t have to wait
	8:54 AM	Jason:	And since he’s just going their to vape (or do something not involving food), not feeling very trusting
	8:55 AM	Jason:	If he’s inside the house, like list time I was sure I locked it up, I’ll know he has a key or is breaking in anyhow
	9:02 AM	Jessica:	yeah, his room is nasty. Make him do that asap. Not sure how he’s going to be the next few weeks if just whatever attitude or be more of a jerk and go do whatever he wants
	9:04 AM	Jason:	I know :( I so want him to have happy childhood memories. Everyone deserves that.
	9:05 AM	Jessica:	Yeah, horribly sad he won’t have all the senior memories
	9:10 AM	Jason:	I’ll try to have him clean his room. I expect it will be like his dishes though where I ask, he says “okay,” then does nothing.
	9:11 AM	Jason:	It’s Friday!
	9:11 AM	Jason:	River was steaming with morning sun coming through. The usual for this time of year.
	9:12 AM	Jessica:	yeah, it was really cool. Hunter and I were commenting on it when I brought him to school. Assumed you’d snag pics
	9:13 AM	Jason:	I got one but not better than what I’ve taken before.
	9:13 AM	Jessica:	yea, guess can only take so many of those
	1:00 PM	Jessica:	well on the plus side of in-house detention he isn’t tardy or absent
	1:01 PM	Jason:	i guess there’s that. but also not going anything done, though i suppose that’s not really a difference.
	1:05 PM	Jessica:	yeah, just being babysat really
	1:15 PM	Jason:	am i picking up brenna from gymnastics?
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	yep
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	I forgot to make her clean up her crazy concoctions she left outside
	1:19 PM	Jason:	of course concoctions
	1:19 PM	Jessica:	there’s 4 bowls and a lot of flour, pretty sure the dough is going to start rising
	1:30 PM	Jason:	you’re free to play with it now
	1:30 PM	Jessica:	gee thanks😬
	3:44 PM	Jason:	nerf gun battle
	3:48 PM	Jessica:	are you winning?
	3:49 PM	Jason:	no
	3:49 PM	Jason:	but not losing either
	3:50 PM	Jessica:	productive Friday
	4:03 PM	Jessica:	Brenna trying to ask you something
	4:14 PM	Jason:	Do you know what time she needs picked up?
	4:14 PM	Jason:	She asked to be picked up early but don’t know when
	4:17 PM	Jessica:	It would have to be about six, wants to do the Riverside movie night. I told her too last minute and she has already missed two days of gymnastics this week. There will be others
	4:17 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:40 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:33 PM	Jason:	No hunter yet

Saturday, October 6, 2018

	8:11 AM	Jessica:	Did he show up?
	8:12 AM	Jason:	I haven’t gotten up to check. Just in bed reading. I’ll go look.
	8:15 AM	Jason:	Not here
	8:16 AM	Jason:	Brenna says she never heard anything
	8:18 AM	Jessica:	Betting he didn’t go to Saturday class. Okay, just let me know if he does up. I’ll try and track down
	8:18 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:20 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Still no show?
	1:21 PM	Jason:	Guess I should check room before I answer
	1:21 PM	Jason:	Nope
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	Guess he wants to go even earlier
	1:22 PM	Jessica:	Not sure what else to do
	1:23 PM	Jason:	Me neither
	1:24 PM	Jason:	Watch Brenna dance, it helps
	1:24 PM	Jessica:	Seems pointless to call police, God knows which friends he’s with
	1:25 PM	Jason:	I’d give him the day
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	1:25 PM	Jessica:	Just cleaned this
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, my thoughts too
	2:28 PM	Jessica:	Looks like he was on messenger a few hours ago so...
	2:29 PM	Jason:	He has laptop?
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	I think he’s going to disappear for the weekend to do what he wants knowing he’s already in trouble
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	I’ll show up to school Monday
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	Must be, if not upstairs
	2:29 PM	Jessica:	Who knows anymore
	5:29 PM	Jessica:	Ask Brenna if she needs anything else other than violin
	5:35 PM	Jason:	She says more clothes
	5:36 PM	Jessica:	Okay, will randomly grab then
	5:37 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	10:01 PM	Jason:	No sign of Hunter
	10:16 PM	Jason:	Messenger indicating it can’t reach you so letting you know there’s been no sign of hunter
	11:09 PM	Jason:	Not sure why messages showing unsent

Sunday, October 7, 2018

	8:29 AM	Jessica:	Hmm, not sure
	8:31 AM	Jessica:	Eventually he’ll need clothes. Figured he make a weekend of disappearing
	8:32 AM	Jason:	Works now
	11:12 AM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	11:13 AM	Jason:	We only play violin music here now
	11:52 AM	Jason:	Is there a new driving arrangement? There are some days I can’t leave early.
	11:56 AM	Jason:	Finished it
	11:56 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:32 PM	Jessica:	Nice. I’ll get ahold of the other parent tomorrow. Brenna out twice last week so didn’t have the opportunity
	12:33 PM	Jessica:	What days can you not in case I need to?
	1:10 PM	Jason:	Just Tuesday cannot
	1:10 PM	Jason:	Odd that messages to you always show unsent now
	1:12 PM	Jessica:	That is weird, getting them
	1:12 PM	Jessica:	Okay, will try and get that covered
	2:09 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	2:09 PM	Jason:	More jalapeños
	3:08 PM	Jason:	Hunter is here
	3:09 PM	Jessica:	And did he say anything?
	3:09 PM	Jason:	No, I didn’t hear him come in, went straight upstairs Brenna said
	3:09 PM	Jason:	Just now
	3:10 PM	Jason:	Brenna says he just left again
	3:10 PM	Jessica:	Okay, will put call into Scott and do some planning for his flight, not going to waste time arguing with him out heating bs. Want to  confirm if he went to Saturday school as well
	3:11 PM	Jason:	He’s here
	3:11 PM	Jessica:	Are you serious? It’s probably going to be a matter of booking a flight, pulling him out of school unexpectedly and taking him to the airport
	3:12 PM	Jason:	Says he went to Saturday school
	3:14 PM	Jason:	Brenna biking to meet a new friend
	3:14 PM	Jason:	Sasha
	3:15 PM	Jason:	Hunter says the friend he was with took him to sit in some F18 jets and one blew up
	3:16 PM	Jason:	I also gained the ability to emit lasers from my eyes but didn’t think it worth mentioning
	3:17 PM	Jessica:	I just can’t even 😂
	5:09 PM	Jason:	Do you have contact info for Brenna friend Sasha or parent? Brenna was supposed to message me when she got there but isn’t responding.
	5:11 PM	Jason:	Oh, I think I hear her.
	5:13 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	5:13 PM	Jason:	Essentials: phone and slime
	6:27 PM	Jessica:	Sasha’s number for future: 503-853-5883
	6:30 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:11 PM	Jason:	Successful Sasha visit. Quick bike ride from here. She did a good job of checking in and leaving when I said to.
	9:39 PM	Jason:	Hunter is hoping you’ll bring him some clothes before school
	9:45 PM	Jessica:	😂😂😂😂😂
	9:46 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I told him he’s free to do laundry
	9:46 PM	Jason:	I did two loads today
	9:46 PM	Jessica:	Guess he should have not disappeared all weekend. I’ll deal with before he leaves
	9:47 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀

Monday, October 8, 2018

	8:30 AM	Jason:	Hunter managed to make it to school (or out of the house, anyway) with clothes he had
	8:31 AM	Jessica:	such a difficult task
	8:32 AM	Jessica:	I emailed Cristy to see if he went to Saturday school
	8:32 AM	Jessica:	Though not sure it matters,
	8:33 AM	Jessica:	He has in house detention again today
	8:35 AM	Jason:	Claiming he went to Saturday school was in the same breath about the F-18 exploding (odd that didn’t make the news) so good to check.
	8:36 AM	Jessica:	Still, the fact that he just disappeared From Friday to Sunday knowing he’s not supposed to go anywhere and never contacting us....done
	8:36 AM	Jason:	Yeah
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	Hunter wants lunch money on schoolbucks account
	8:53 AM	Jason:	i’ll add some
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	messaged Scott that he needs to come now, looking at flights
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	not sure how he’s on FB if in detention
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Okay. Seems he was really trying to be on best behavior last night. The usual three hours of contrition.
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Maybe they let him have laptop
	8:55 AM	Jessica:	yeah, the few hours after doing things he’s not supposed to, probably trying to figure out what the consequence is going to be
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	he did go to Saturday school
	8:59 AM	Jason:	a little surprising
	8:59 AM	Jessica:	very
	9:00 AM	Jason:	he said something like “i had to go or they would kick me out”
	9:00 AM	Jason:	but i don’t really listen to anything he says. i hear it, just don’t take it as representative of any reality.
	9:01 AM	Jessica:	I actually do think that’s the case, he would have been suspended for truancy or something along those lines, just funny that doing no work, flunking classes and skipping classes has the same result and doesn’t seem to care
	9:02 AM	Jessica:	Not sure if just book him to go now or give him till the Nov 3rd date. Even though I know what’s going to happen
	9:02 AM	Jason:	maybe it’s the idea of losing access to his friends
	9:02 AM	Jessica:	I think that’s EXACTLY it
	9:07 AM	Jessica:	I’m going to Godsmack tomorrow 😂
	9:07 AM	Jason:	oh yea
	9:07 AM	Jason:	was that your idea?
	9:07 AM	Jessica:	seriously?
	9:08 AM	Jason:	okay, probably not, trying to guess who. not sure which of your friends like them. dana?
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	No, Dana, Terry, TRacy and some others were going. Shinedown also playing and now Terry and Tracy both out of town and the other person to, so Terry gave the extra tickets to Dana
	9:08 AM	Jessica:	too
	9:09 AM	Jason:	Right, I think I saw Terry post about them (amidst the politics). Have fun. :)
	9:09 AM	Jessica:	Is till have the earplugs if needed
	9:09 AM	Jason:	Good to bring them
	9:37 AM	Jessica:	What are your thoughts on booking his flight this week rather than the 3rd?
	9:37 AM	Jason:	My opinion would be driven partly by cost difference
	9:38 AM	Jason:	Does Scott have a plan for him there? Would he try to enroll in school?
	9:39 AM	Jason:	If cost is similar and the plan is the same over there whether now or later than I guess better to just do it
	9:39 AM	Jason:	Still feels really sad; I know more so for you
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	Flights about 100 more to do early
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	I think it would be up to Hunter to make the effort and enroll there if he really wants to graduate. Effort has to be on him. Scott’s rule is that he has to either be doing the things needed to graduate or get his GED or be working to stay there. Otherwise same thing when he hit 18, on your own, couch surf with friends
	9:42 AM	Jessica:	yeah, definitely sick over this, trying to distance myself emotionally from it, putting it in a box to cope
	9:43 AM	Jason:	$100 diff seems acceptable
	9:43 AM	Jason:	Any input from school counselor?
	9:45 AM	Jessica:	nope, she’s been included on the discussion regarding his detention, not on track to graduate etc. I think they are all having the same conversations with him, he’s just saying I don’t care and not putting in any effort. Only suggestion I’ve gotten so far is the Frank Church alternative
	9:47 AM	Jason:	Right. Okay, I guess see what can be booked.
	9:48 AM	Jason:	The feeling in my stomach is almost like we’re removing him from life support. :(
	9:49 AM	Jessica:	that is the perfect analogy
	12:04 PM	Jason:	that is some spicy salad
	12:09 PM	Jason:	i think this may actually give me a stomach ache
	12:09 PM	Jason:	perfect
	12:14 PM	Jason:	I think the peppers I put on last time weren’t jalapeños. I noticed yesterday there were similar looking peppers right to them, pepperoncinos ... burning.
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	That was a LOT of jalapenos!
	12:14 PM	Jason:	*right next
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	That’s gonna burn
	12:14 PM	Jason:	I thought, “these aren’t very hot” so got a lot more.
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	you’re screwed
	12:15 PM	Jason:	and put in whole onion to augment
	12:15 PM	Jason:	i’ve had like four bites and feel kind of full
	12:15 PM	Jason:	full/sick
	12:15 PM	Jessica:	oh god, have fun in the bathroom...hope you have something to read
	12:15 PM	Jason:	:(
	12:17 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	12:17 PM	Jason:	leftovers if you want
	12:17 PM	Jessica:	Ummmmm, I think I’ll pass and get soup!
	1:00 PM	Jason:	Brenna knows nothing about the train ride thing I sent so no upset if you decide against
	1:03 PM	Jessica:	Should be fine, I don’t have anything planned for her Saturday since birthday party Sunday.
	1:04 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:43 PM	Jason:	Brenna is going to beat all the boys in that fitness testing
	2:00 PM	Jessica:	Oh, most definitely!
	4:11 PM	Jessica:	Scott looking at booking his flight for this weekend
	4:11 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	Parent Teacher Conference, I have us signed up for 5:20 om Thursday the 25th
	4:51 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:51 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	4:51 PM	Jason:	Where I find Brenna
	4:52 PM	Jessica:	Oh jeez
	5:14 PM	Jessica:	Hunter there?
	6:19 PM	Jason:	Yeah, he’s here. Want him to call?
	6:20 PM	Jessica:	No, I’ll wait to talk to him in person tomorrow
	6:20 PM	Jason:	Okay. He didn’t know he’s seeing you then, though.
	6:21 PM	Jessica:	I know, was going to stop by before concert
	6:22 PM	Jason:	Sounds good
	6:22 PM	Jason:	Have things been arranged?
	6:23 PM	Jessica:	Monday flight
	6:27 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:28 PM	Jessica:	Still undecided if I should say anything about flight or just let him continue his expected pattern and then put him on a flight. Worried about weekend repeat, except not showing up Sunday
	6:31 PM	Jason:	Agreed
	6:32 PM	Jason:	Let him know decision, I think, but not timing
	6:32 PM	Jessica:	Probably good idea

Tuesday, October 9, 2018

	8:08 AM	Jessica:	Hunter marked absent for English
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	now also for 2nd
	8:47 AM	Jessica:	guess booking the flight was the right call
	8:50 AM	Jason:	That was a nice bike ride
	8:50 AM	Jessica:	splashed in the the puddle I assume
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	Brenna bike?
	8:51 AM	Jason:	Got back from dropping Brenna at choir and found him still in bed. Got him up. Not sure if he actually left since I had to jet (in the RAIN).
	8:51 AM	Jason:	No, she didn’t bike. I told her I’d message her with who is picking her up.
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	oh yeah, choir
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	I told her last night and this morning I was
	8:51 AM	Jason:	It was pouring rain so didn’t make her ride.
	8:51 AM	Jessica:	Amber getting me Stella’s mom contact info
	8:52 AM	Jason:	Lots of puddle splashing, yes. Sad there’s no bike parking here.
	8:53 AM	Jessica:	yeah, that’s a problem
	8:54 AM	Jason:	Just the bike rack which now happens to be situated within a huge puddle itself.
	8:54 AM	Jessica:	oh hell
	8:55 AM	Jason:	wah wah
	9:56 AM	Jessica:	your costco prescription ready
	9:56 AM	Jason:	oh thanks

	11:36 AM	Jessica:	wasn’t sure why I was getting one
	11:36 AM	Jason:	was going to send you picture of the USB fan drying my socks but too dark under desk
	11:36 AM	Jessica:	let’s just say because I’m awesome
	11:37 AM	Jason:	of course
	11:37 AM	Jessica:	haha, better keep extra socks in your bag
	11:37 AM	Jason:	i think so
	2:23 PM	Jason:	what should I message brenna about pickup?
	2:23 PM	Jessica:	The same thing I told her last night, and both of you this moring
	2:23 PM	Jessica:	morning
	2:24 PM	Jason:	i think you said you were getting contact info
	2:25 PM	Jason:	oh i see, you are :)
	2:25 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	2:25 PM	Jessica:	Working to get Stella’s parents contact info.
	2:25 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:26 PM	Jason:	then you have the awesome concert
	2:32 PM	Jessica:	yep, to tired to be excited about it currently.
	2:36 PM	Jessica:	I’ll drop Hunter’s clothes off on the way to get Brenna.
	2:36 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	2:36 PM	Jason:	still hoping to talk with him?
	2:37 PM	Jessica:	yes and no. just so frustrated, especially with this morning as well. thinking of leaving it until weekend. If he’s there we’ll see.
	2:37 PM	Jason:	understood
	2:47 PM	Jessica:	There is a new infinite campus app, they will be retiring the other. Stupid thing alerts me every time  grade is entered for either of them, or marked absent or tardy.
	2:48 PM	Jessica:	Looks like Brenna missing Parallels & Meridians in Social Studies and got a 70 on her Week 2 newspaper for same subject
	2:53 PM	Jessica:	just got another notice, Hunter marked tardy for biology. I need to turn this app off!
	2:54 PM	Jason:	Yeah, save your sanity
	2:55 PM	Jason:	I’ll check on Brenna’s work
	2:55 PM	Jason:	Hunter must be leaving to vape, is all I can think
	2:56 PM	Jessica:	I quit trying to guess or figure it out
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	Talked to Hunter, he doesn’t know when his flight is. Just that he will be going soon
	4:48 PM	Jessica:	Piper’s mom brought girls...of course I was already there so not that helpful, other than was able to catch Hunter
	4:54 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:54 PM	Jason:	Now to get psyched for the concert ...
	4:54 PM	Jessica:	Not going
	4:55 PM	Jason:	In that case, get psyched for Wednesday
	4:55 PM	Jason:	Draining to talk with Hunter?
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	What’s Wednesday?
	4:55 PM	Jessica:	Very, most of the group bailed so was easy to get out of
	4:57 PM	Jason:	It’s just tomorrow, that’s all
	4:57 PM	Jessica:	Gotcha
	4:57 PM	Jason:	Sounds like it wasn’t exciting you anyway. Now you can have a free night to charge your batteries however you wish.
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	Yeah and help Dana get ready for her competition, she’s very frazzled so was glad when she was okay with not going
	5:05 PM	Jason:	helping frazzled people is your superpower
	5:06 PM	Jason:	or curse, not sure
	8:58 PM	Jason:	Brenna would like to call
	8:58 PM	Jason:	She left her phone at gym
	8:58 PM	Jason:	Never mind, she just found it
	8:59 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	9:04 PM	Jessica:	All her friends excited about her party from the messages I’m getting, think parents want to join
	9:05 PM	Jason:	Sounds like it should be fun
	9:06 PM	Jessica:	Hopefully....
	9:35 PM	Jessica:	If you’re okay with it I want to come over Thursday morning before school for her birthday to wake her up
	9:35 PM	Jason:	Definitely
	9:36 PM	Jessica:	Thanks
	9:44 PM	Jason:	Being tortured with Brenna brain teasers
	9:57 PM	Jason:	Tried to convince her it’s more of a birth space than birth day since it’s about the planet returning to the same point in space where she was born
	10:08 PM	Jessica:	Howd that go?
	10:09 PM	Jason:	She listened to me argue it for about 15 seconds
	10:09 PM	Jessica:	Sounds accurate 😂
	10:09 PM	Jason:	Then told me I was wrong
	10:10 PM	Jessica:	😂

Wednesday, October 10, 2018

	9:39 AM	Jessica:	well no app alerts so he must have made it this morning
	9:48 AM	Jason:	you were supposed to turn that thing off
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	probably will after this week, for now it’s real time updates on him missing class
	9:52 AM	Jason:	Kind of surprised he made it. He didn’t say a word last night.
	9:53 AM	Jessica:	just as I said that...app alert that his biology grade is updated to a D 60.55%
	10:05 AM	Jason:	not sure how that’s possible. slimmest D imaginable.
	10:06 AM	Jessica:	looks like a 10pt assignment entered, most likely done in class both D’s are just barely that and the F’s are well...what is lower than an F?
	10:10 AM	Jason:	good question
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	guess some biology getting done today current alerts: 61.38%, now 63.05%
	10:28 AM	Jessica:	I emailed his counselor to let he know what will be happening
	10:30 AM	Jessica:	guess you can offer to let him use his medicine
	10:41 AM	Jason:	Sure, I’ll offer. Does it matter at this point?
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	guess we send it with and he can decide if he chooses to try and put in the work there
	10:45 AM	Jason:	Oh sure, as far as sending it to Scott’s
	10:59 AM	Jessica:	Holy crap, Scott actually called Lisa yesterday and had his transcripts sent over.
	11:00 AM	Jason:	Woah. I’d say “better late than never” but I don’t know if that’s true this time.
	11:01 AM	Jason:	... as far as getting on top of things
	11:01 AM	Jessica:	yeah, I know he’s pretty furious and if this makes him actually have the battle with him then....well I don’t even know
	11:13 AM	Jason:	no support squirrels https://www.thedailybeast.com/woman-booted-from-flight-for-boarding-with-emotional-support-squirrel
	11:15 AM	Jessica:	well damn, now I have to change my plans
	11:17 AM	Jason:	figured
	11:18 AM	Jessica:	Now what do I take to Hawaii with me? 😂
	12:41 PM	Jessica:	Stella’s mom Laura will be taking on Tuesday’s and Fridays starting this Friday
	12:42 PM	Jason:	yea
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	They just don’t want to do take home because of how late it gets and are always flexible with that
	12:42 PM	Jessica:	Which is perfect
	12:43 PM	Jason:	where do they live?
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	She’s sending me the address
	1:18 PM	Jessica:	Next Friday Brenna doesn’t have school. I am in a virtual class that I’ve gotten permission to do from home 7am-11am for my series 63 test (thank god last one) My flight is at 2 so I can just drop her after my class at the house.
	1:19 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	1:20 PM	Jessica:	Keeping this surprise from Tracy has been HARD
	1:23 PM	Jason:	You think successful?
	1:28 PM	Jessica:	So far, the trick has been to only text Terry or meet with him here during the day. All the girls fly in Friday so we can decorate and grocery shop for the house and then they arrive Saturday morning. Terry may hate us all by the time it’s over😂
	1:29 PM	Jason:	I’m sure you’ll all have a blast
	1:32 PM	Jessica:	Hoping so, glad I bonused so I could go
	2:47 PM	Jason:	Second day of afternoon “town hall” meetings. Hopefully done with that for the year.
	2:49 PM	Jessica:	what are those for?
	2:50 PM	Jason:	oh, just executives describing acquisitions, goals and such
	2:50 PM	Jessica:	for work or city?
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	Town Hall makes me thing government
	2:51 PM	Jason:	i guess “town hall” does sound like city. But just Vacasa.
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	Ahhh, still boring
	2:51 PM	Jason:	“town hall” in the sense we’re all just lounged around while the present
	2:51 PM	Jason:	*they
	2:51 PM	Jessica:	hopefully with strong coffee
	2:51 PM	Jason:	yes. and they supply extra food for those
	2:52 PM	Jessica:	well that’s something
	2:52 PM	Jason:	I’m just killing time now since I can’t start anything before I need to bike.
	2:52 PM	Jessica:	but some of that bailey’s in your coffee
	2:52 PM	Jason:	Good idea for when I’m home. I should ask them to get some here.
	3:34 PM	Jason:	Brenna costume here. Left in her room to surprise her later.
	3:34 PM	Jason:	Assume your morning visit is also a surprise
	3:34 PM	Jessica:	she’ll be thrilled
	3:34 PM	Jessica:	yes
	3:35 PM	Jessica:	dinner at 5:15 tomorrow
	3:35 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:36 PM	Jason:	I’ll have to bike fast
	3:37 PM	Jessica:	I can try and get it a bit later
	3:38 PM	Jason:	It’s okay. Only have to leave like ten minutes earlier for that to work.
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	3:38 PM	Jason:	Thanks for booking
	3:38 PM	Jessica:	no problem
	4:43 PM	Jessica:	Who knows what device he’s got now
	4:43 PM	Jessica:	Assuming also not home
	4:44 PM	Jason:	He was home at some point to bring in Brenna’s package but no, not now
	4:44 PM	Jason:	We saw him walking by school on way to gymnastics
	4:44 PM	Jason:	Timberline
	4:45 PM	Jason:	He saw us, waved
	4:46 PM	Jason:	He still has his own laptop doesn’t he?
	4:46 PM	Jason:	Our investment in his future ...
	4:46 PM	Jessica:	Yep, though he had left bag etc at cordors Monday so not sure if he got it
	6:58 PM	Jason:	I assume you’re just here to surprise her in the morning, not bring her to school. I’m planning to get her some treats to bring tomorrow. But if that’s something you were planning to do (not my expectation), I’ll hold off.
	7:02 PM	Jessica:	I just got her a small fruit tart for in the morning. Grabbing balloons now. Hadn’t heard of she was wanting to bring treats so that’s awesome if you grab
	7:02 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:02 PM	Jason:	She didn’t want me to do it on my own so waiting for her to get home.
	7:02 PM	Jason:	Obviously I would choose poorly.
	7:03 PM	Jessica:	Obviously 😂
	7:03 PM	Jason:	Everybody gets a jalapeno!
	7:05 PM	Jessica:	Oh hell
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	7:06 PM	Jessica:	Okay maybe a unicorn instead of balloons
	7:06 PM	Jason:	ooh, you’re going to make her happy
	7:06 PM	Jason:	she was hinting strongly that i needed to get her one of those when we went to walgreens for something
	7:06 PM	Jason:	oh yeah, shoelaces
	7:07 PM	Jessica:	I need to grab some?
	7:08 PM	Jason:	No, we found them
	7:08 PM	Jason:	That’s all we were after since I ignored her pleas
	7:08 PM	Jason:	those pink laces in her boots. i thought she showed you.
	7:13 PM	Jessica:	Ohh yes
	7:13 PM	Jason:	I’m excited for her to be excited
	7:23 PM	Jessica:	Me too😁
	7:24 PM	Jason:	I’ll get my phone out here so I can record her costume discovery. step 1.
	7:27 PM	Jason:	Hunter went out the door an hour ago saying he was walking over to the ATM to get $20 you gave him for golf. He walks a lot slower than I do.
	7:28 PM	Jessica:	I haven’t put it in and he knows that. I put him off. It’s for Tuesday...he won’t be here
	7:28 PM	Jason:	I should have known.
	7:29 PM	Jason:	Now that I think of it, I put a deposit alert on his account back when he had a job, thinking I’d recoup the bike accessory expenses like he promised. Silly me.
	7:29 PM	Jason:	... and I didn’t get an alert about your $20
	7:33 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, probably need to tell him this weekend so he can get his stuff together
	7:34 PM	Jessica:	That reminds me, let’s talk about the phone at some point. I have all the stuff it came in so could reset this weekend and maybe give to her after he leaves?
	7:35 PM	Jason:	Sounds fair
	7:35 PM	Jessica:	Just have to figure out if transferring over to your plan or keep on mine and transfer her number
	7:36 PM	Jason:	Oh yeah, the number
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	I can’t just disconnect the phone and give to her on yours or get hot with an immediate 1000
	7:36 PM	Jessica:	Hit
	7:36 PM	Jason:	Right
	7:38 PM	Jessica:	We’ll  figure it out later
	7:38 PM	Jason:	I assume we just need advice from a Verizon person
	7:39 PM	Jessica:	That what I did today
	7:39 PM	Jessica:	She said DON’T disconnect. Either transfer phone to yours or activate and change number
	7:40 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:02 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	9:05 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	9:06 PM	Jessica:	Love it!!!
	9:08 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	9:08 PM	Jason:	Oh, I cut off the part where she flew
	9:09 PM	Jason:	It was amazing
	9:12 PM	Jessica:	😂
	9:12 PM	Jason:	Now off to get treats
	9:12 PM	Jason:	“My costume is so good!"
	9:12 PM	Jason:	“I didn’t know it had gloves, I didn’t know it had a neck thing, it’s pretty, it’s very detailed ..."
	9:13 PM	Jessica:	Glad she’s happy

Thursday, October 11, 2018

	6:59 AM	Jessica:	Be there probably a bit before 8
	7:03 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	8:33 AM	Jason:	Cat is terrified of big unicorn
	8:34 AM	Jason:	Hissed and tore off
	8:34 AM	Jessica:	😂😂😂
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	cake ordered
	10:26 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:08 PM	Jason:	Just waiting on hunter
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	He knew, I would leave without him
	5:13 PM	Jessica:	Just seated
	5:17 PM	Jason:	Don’t see you so going back to front

Friday, October 12, 2018

	8:26 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:31 AM	Jason:	First floor by patio where I park my bike
	8:33 AM	Jessica:	Dangerous
	8:34 AM	Jason:	two bars also going in where Angells was
	8:34 AM	Jason:	you probably know all that
	8:34 AM	Jessica:	Didn’t know that
	8:42 AM	Jason:	I assume you got a paper copy. You were sick?
	8:42 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:10 AM	Jessica:	yep, had a bladder infection, hadn’t seen a paper copy. I’ll check my EOB and submit it
	9:11 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	9:11 AM	Jason:	Totally forgot to prep cat for spay today. Had to reschedule for Monday. She was supposed to not eat starting yesterday evening.
	9:11 AM	Jessica:	ooops
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	confused. Blue Cross paid it
	9:19 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	9:20 AM	Jason:	Not sure. Just got the e-mail saying there was a bill ...
	9:22 AM	Jason:	Maybe just crossed wires
	9:22 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	9:40 AM	Jessica:	submitted the blue cross statement to St Lukes showing paid.
	9:40 AM	Jason:	i.e. doing their job for them
	9:41 AM	Jessica:	still have to for the allergy place too. they keep sending me a bill for 154 though I can see by the statements and the 200 plus we paid out of pocket that day they have actually been overpaid
	9:43 AM	Jason:	:(
	1:58 PM	Jessica:	Maybe let Hunter know he needs to deep clean his room before I get him later. I will let him know tonight his flight is Monday.
	2:00 PM	Jason:	I am pretty much counting on cleaning it myself. It’s isn’t terrible since I’ve not been buying any snacks. But I’ll ask him to clean it, see what happens.
	2:01 PM	Jason:	Not sure yet if Brenna wants to ride the trains. I have no plans so don’t need a verdict until midday tomorrow.
	2:03 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	4:58 PM	Jason:	Hunter isn’t here so no point in coming to get him yet.
	4:59 PM	Jessica:	He messaged. I told him he has to go there to clean room before he comes here
	5:00 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:37 PM	Jessica:	Let me know if he shows up
	5:37 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	5:38 PM	Jason:	I thought he was here a few minutes ago. Just the cat. “How the hell did you make all that noise?" I ask her but she never tells me.
	5:39 PM	Jessica:	Unicorn defense if needed
	5:39 PM	Jason:	Good point
	5:39 PM	Jason:	Crap, that reminds me I need to go get Brenna’s bike. Off I go.
	8:12 PM	Jason:	No Hunter yet
	8:17 PM	Jessica:	Shocking
	8:18 PM	Jason:	Sorry, should have warned you to sit down first
	8:19 PM	Jessica:	I’d tell you his story from earlier...but seems pointless
	8:30 PM	Jason:	Yeah, I prefer long form fiction
	11:57 PM	Jessica:	Locking house down, Hunter not here

Saturday, October 13, 2018

	9:47 AM	Jason:	No sign of Hunter. His room is messier than I remembered, if that’s possible.
	9:50 AM	Jessica:	Guess last weekend of dealing with this
	10:31 AM	Jason:	Brenna asking to bring Piper to train ride. I told her they couldn’t be spazzy and ask for stuff, like they usually do. Just giving you a heads-up. I guess I would have to go pick her up first.
	10:32 AM	Jessica:	Holy crap
	10:33 AM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	10:33 AM	Jason:	He found a way in
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	I just now noticed him
	10:34 AM	Jessica:	No clue how he got in unless girls let him in this morning
	10:34 AM	Jason:	Oh, is Piper there?
	10:35 AM	Jessica:	Yes
	10:36 AM	Jason:	Jeez, Brenna didn’t say that (see my message above). Okay, I would pick them up at 12:45 for train.
	10:36 AM	Jessica:	Sounds good
	10:36 AM	Jason:	Would be nice if they’ve already had lunch so not begging. Unless you haven’t shopped yet. Then I can plan restaurant stop too.
	10:37 AM	Jessica:	I’ll make sure they eat first
	10:37 AM	Jason:	Thank you
	10:37 AM	Jason:	I’m pretty curious to see these trains
	10:38 AM	Jason:	South of Nampa but don’t tell girls or they’ll thing it’s too far to drive
	10:38 AM	Jason:	*think
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	Good point
	10:38 AM	Jason:	Chicken Dinner Road, if you remember seeing that
	10:38 AM	Jessica:	Still messaging to see if Piper can go
	10:39 AM	Jason:	Ah, okay. Personally, I’d rather just have Brenna since they spaz out together. But it will be fun either way.
	10:39 AM	Jason:	Need to take Brenna to newly opened history museum too.
	10:39 AM	Jason:	I have a picture in there somewhere I’m curious to find.
	10:40 AM	Jason:	(A very boring picture, if you recall)
	10:40 AM	Jessica:	Oh yeah, curious to see the new remodel
	10:41 AM	Jason:	Took long enough. We visited together not long before they shut down.
	10:44 AM	Jessica:	I recall. It did take forever
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	Piper can’t go. Has gymnastics
	10:53 AM	Jason:	Ah. Hope Brenna still wants to go ...
	10:53 AM	Jessica:	Brenna is seeing if Delaney can go
	10:54 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:08 AM	Jessica:	Looking like Delaney will probably be able to go. She’s finishing her soccer game. Done at 11:30, no afternoon plans. She’s a lot more chill than Piper 😂
	11:08 AM	Jason:	I like that
	11:41 AM	Jason:	look closely
	11:41 AM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	11:41 AM	Jason:	it’s not animated
	11:43 AM	Jessica:	That’s crazy!
	11:44 AM	Jason:	stronger effect if you view it big
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	I bet!
	11:57 AM	Jessica:	Delaney being dropped here at 12:30. Piper about to leave now...kid switch
	11:58 AM	Jason:	nice. i’ll be there about 12:45.
	11:58 AM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:10 PM	Jessica:	Delaney mom wanting an idea of when back
	12:10 PM	Jason:	no later than 4:00 i would think
	12:10 PM	Jason:	45 minute drive
	12:10 PM	Jason:	both ways
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:14 PM	Jessica:	I let her know. She was just planning for IXL homework time
	12:15 PM	Jason:	Hunter been told the plan yet? I’d like to come to the airport. I’ll probably work from home Monday anyway to do the drives for cat spaying.
	12:23 PM	Jessica:	Yes
	1:48 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	1:50 PM	Jessica:	That’s so cool
	1:51 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	1:53 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	1:55 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	1:55 PM	Jason:	Girls say they’re hungry 😀
	1:56 PM	Jessica:	Of course. Brenna and Piper had ramen noodles and apples (because Piper won’t eat anything else) not sure about Delaney
	1:56 PM	Jason:	No worries
	1:56 PM	Jason:	Just spazzing I don’t like
	1:57 PM	Jessica:	Agreed
	1:57 PM	Jason:	Still on train
	2:15 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	2:16 PM	Jessica:	Long ride
	2:21 PM	Jason:	On second train
	2:33 PM	Jason:	Don’t mind taking them to restaurant but it’s your day so want to check
	2:33 PM	Jason:	Don’t mind at all returning them now
	2:33 PM	Jason:	We’ve left the trains
	2:42 PM	Jessica:	That’s fine just dealing with Hunter and chores
	3:06 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	3:07 PM	Jason:	They wanted Olive Garden
	3:07 PM	Jessica:	Olive garden?
	3:07 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, she likes that one. Where I took them a couple weeks ago
	3:08 PM	Jason:	Busy here
	3:08 PM	Jessica:	Saturday afternoon
	3:12 PM	Jessica:	Let me know when you head out. Leaving here about 4 to get her cake in garden city but doors will be unlocked
	3:12 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	3:21 PM	Jason:	Girls getting hangry
	3:23 PM	Jessica:	Good thing they have they’re phones
	3:25 PM	Jason:	Upset trains weren’t “real”
	3:25 PM	Jason:	Seated now, anger subsiding
	3:26 PM	Jessica:	They will eat a TON of the garlic bread sticks
	3:35 PM	Jessica:	Do you mind if I transfer 100 to get her cake and stuff and I’ll transfer back Monday? Payroll didn’t hit Friday as planned for some of us.
	3:36 PM	Jason:	Not at all
	3:36 PM	Jessica:	Thanks
	3:44 PM	Jason:	Uh oh, their phones are dying
	3:44 PM	Jessica:	Rebellion on the horizon
	3:45 PM	Jason:	Exactly
	3:55 PM	Jason:	Delaney goes back to your house or hers?
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	You can drop them both here for now. Waiting for answer on their sleepover. I can bring her home
	4:01 PM	Jessica:	Actually have answer. If she goes home first for a couple hours and does her homework and packs then she can stay tonight
	4:02 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	4:03 PM	Jason:	They’re excited
	4:03 PM	Jason:	Good luck
	4:05 PM	Jason:	On our way
	4:05 PM	Jason:	Leftovers for you
	4:58 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	4:59 PM	Jason:	very cool
	4:59 PM	Jason:	she has some chicken strips and fries for you in return :)
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	She’s telling me she’s hungry 😂
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	Only because she wants fruit loops
	5:04 PM	Jason:	well, good thing she has leftovers
	5:04 PM	Jason:	of course
	5:04 PM	Jessica:	I said the same thing, didn’t go over well
	5:04 PM	Jason:	probably no less healthy than fries and chicken strips
	5:06 PM	Jessica:	True
	5:07 PM	Jessica:	Turned Hunter’s phone on for the weekend so he can see, say by to friends
	5:07 PM	Jessica:	He tried the Frank Church argument with me
	5:08 PM	Jason:	i’m sure the promises will flow
	5:08 PM	Jason:	too bad he worked so hard to destroy his own reliability
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Yep, said if it’s important he can set the same up there but he’s had nothing but time and help here. All efforts are 100% on him now
	5:09 PM	Jessica:	Exactly
	5:09 PM	Jason:	I’m sure he doesn’t appreciate that this is as much, probably more upsetting to us than to him
	5:10 PM	Jason:	Because rather than ignore it, we’re actually aware of the future
	5:11 PM	Jessica:	Agree
	5:29 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a photo.
	5:30 PM	Jessica:	Just popped out
	5:30 PM	Jason:	she has quite a collection now
	5:30 PM	Jason:	she needs to cash those in
	5:30 PM	Jessica:	She’s excited to have 5 to cash in
	5:30 PM	Jason:	five nickels, yippee
	6:03 PM	Jason:	you haven’t noticed hunter with extra headphones have you? i’d swear i put my latest pair plus the case in the drawer by my side of the bed. now just the empty case is there.
	6:04 PM	Jessica:	He had white ones this morning
	6:07 PM	Jason:	those are mine
	6:07 PM	Jason:	he got into my drawer
	6:07 PM	Jason:	i have his right here. they have a different connector for iphoneX
	6:07 PM	Jason:	what a jerk
	6:08 PM	Jason:	i found his up in his room buried in clothes. but won’t work for me.
	6:08 PM	Jessica:	Looking through his stuff now
	6:09 PM	Jason:	No emergency, of course, just going to call my mom
	6:09 PM	Jessica:	Must have them on him
	6:10 PM	Jason:	Is he not ther?
	6:10 PM	Jessica:	No, at Josh’s
	6:10 PM	Jason:	What an sense of entitlement that he can go into my drawer and take mine
	6:11 PM	Jessica:	He takes what he wants as usual. Just like the other phone
	6:11 PM	Jason:	just frustrating how many times this happens. can’t even have something simple like headphones.
	6:11 PM	Jessica:	Brenna and I are eating the bag of gummy bears we found in his backpack. Payback 😁
	6:12 PM	Jason:	okay, i feel better then
	6:12 PM	Jason:	:)
	6:12 PM	Jason:	i’m done venting now
	6:12 PM	Jason:	i know he isn’t malicious, just has zero consideration for other people, including his own future self
	6:13 PM	Jason:	if he could press a button that gave him some cake when he wanted it, with the side effect that it tortured us, i’m afraid he’d do it
	6:13 PM	Jason:	don’t venting for the second time
	6:13 PM	Jason:	*done
	6:15 PM	Jason:	now i want some gummies
	6:15 PM	Jason:	i should have salad instead
	6:15 PM	Jessica:	I’m sure he would. Pretty positive he took 20 out of my purse last week as well
	6:16 PM	Jason:	and he wonders why we won’t allow a 104th chance
	6:16 PM	Jessica:	Yeah, not even arguing with him about it. Done deal
	6:17 PM	Jason:	i think i’ll go cut out that tomato plant that’s now almost as big as a car. is brenna going to cash in her teeth or still “saving”?
	6:17 PM	Jessica:	Not sure yet, the one next to it loose now as well.
	6:26 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.

	11:23 AM	Jason:	So cake is back at your place?
	11:24 AM	Jessica:	Yep
	11:24 AM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	11:26 AM	Jason:	Drinks at my place then
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	She wants to do it at Bagley
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	So we have just enough room between our cars to transport them
	11:28 AM	Jessica:	She doesn’t want anybody going in her room there
	11:45 AM	Jason:	Okay. Bagley sounds good.
	11:46 AM	Jason:	Did you find the minion?
	11:48 AM	Jessica:	?
	11:48 AM	Jason:	I shared to your timeline
	11:48 AM	Jessica:	Oh, I saw the pics. Didn’t search for a minion
	11:48 AM	Jason:	I hear you saying you failed
	11:50 AM	Jessica:	🤨
	11:51 AM	Jason:	oh. good one.
	11:51 AM	Jason:	(it’s on the train with the old guy and little dogs)
	11:54 AM	Jessica:	I’ll have to look on the computer
	11:54 AM	Jessica:	Your working from home tomorrow?
	11:55 AM	Jessica:	Will need to drop Brenna to bike and figured Hunter as well so he can clean and pack. Will have him get everything from here today. Bring his large suitcase
	11:55 AM	Jason:	Yep, working from here. Which means I could probably drive Brenna if I’m back in time. Supposed to drop cat at 8:00 AM.
	11:56 AM	Jason:	... then pick her up in afternoon
	11:56 AM	Jason:	I like your optimism about Hunter cleaning. When is his flight?
	12:02 PM	Jessica:	I figured if your there to supervise maybe a bit more will happen
	12:02 PM	Jessica:	6:35pm
	12:03 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:03 PM	Jason:	Dana picking up Brenna from school or should I plan to get her?
	12:04 PM	Jason:	I figure you’ll just get them both when grabbing Hunter
	12:04 PM	Jessica:	She’ll have to bike or you get her. Dana it off town until tomorrow
	12:05 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	Will probably run by there before party to drop cake. Don’t want in Jeep for couple hours
	12:06 PM	Jason:	Makes sense
	12:33 PM	Jessica:	Brenna has changed her mind. Your house for cake, a bit chilly outside
	12:33 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	12:40 PM	Jason:	Is the xbox over there? Just clearing off table, putting a few things in office, and noticed I don’t see it.
	12:43 PM	Jessica:	Nope
	12:45 PM	Jason:	Maybe I didn’t look hard enough
	3:46 PM	Jason:	You sent a video.
	3:46 PM	Jason:	I’m getting them calmed down

	11:39 AM	Jason:	Brenna was crying a bit after we left the cat since they mentioned the tiny chance of anesthesia being fatal.
	11:39 AM	Jason:	I had to give many assurances.
	12:49 PM	Jessica:	Oh no they didn’t....
	12:51 PM	Jason:	It seemed like just a standard disclaimer but Brenna keyed right into it
	12:52 PM	Jason:	I reminded her we’d been under general anesthesia too. She didn’t care about that.
	12:56 PM	Jessica:	Jessica sent a sticker.
	1:06 PM	Jessica:	Are you taking her to pick up?
	1:07 PM	Jason:	Yeah
	1:25 PM	Jason:	You may have to pry that phone from his hands :)
	1:26 PM	Jessica:	Oh I know. I have warned him. I’ll turn it off here shortly
	1:42 PM	Jason:	Hunter wanting to go visit friends. I said to check with you.
	1:53 PM	Jessica:	If he’s back by 4:30 and his room is clean and he’s totally packed
	1:53 PM	Jason:	checked his room. it seemed clean in the sense that there aren’t clothes on the floor anymore.
	1:54 PM	Jason:	didn’t see xbox anywhere. i guess he sold it? or I put it somewhere I totally forgot? but i don’t think so. just had it in the office, locked.
	1:56 PM	Jessica:	no clue on the xbox, sold is probably a good bet. He can deal with Scott on that one
	1:56 PM	Jason:	yeah ...
	4:46 PM	Jason:	Waiting in line for cat
	4:47 PM	Jessica:	I’ll be by to get Hunter around 5:30
	4:48 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	6:27 PM	Jason:	The address I have is
	6:27 PM	Jason:	3170 Lewis River Rd
Woodland, WA 98674
	6:29 PM	Jessica:	Thanks
	6:30 PM	Jason:	Meant as more of a question :)
	6:31 PM	Jessica:	Oh, I know it was 3160. I’ll find out
	6:31 PM	Jason:	You: 󰀀
	7:22 PM	Jason:	Felt so sad going in his room to turn off the light, looking around
	7:24 PM	Jessica:	So very sad
	8:39 PM	Jason:	You sent a photo.
	8:39 PM	Jason:	Cats new hiding spot

	9:45 AM	Jason:	Went to make latte for first time ever here and we’re out of milk. What a dump.
	9:51 AM	Jessica:	Rough
	11:53 AM	Jason:	Scott says the address is still 3160 Lewis River Rd. Not in the new place yet.
	11:53 AM	Jason:	And he spelled “your” wrong
	12:05 PM	Jessica:	Jessica: 󰀀
	12:06 PM	Jessica:	What do you mean not in the new place?
	12:06 PM	Jason:	Maybe I translated wrong. Full message: “Its 3160 Lewis River Rd Woodland Wa 98674 for know it will be changing when the new houses and road goes in don’t when that will happen."
	12:12 PM	Jessica:	Oh, I know what that means. Ok
