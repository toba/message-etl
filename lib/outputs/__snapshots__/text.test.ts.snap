   <p>Do you ever have those moments where somebody is so mind shatteringly selfish and horrible that it may take you a few days to even  put the right words together, because it is so unfathomable for most of the population to be that way?? Yet they think they are logical and normal?? Even though everybody around them has to put effort into tolerating being around them??? No matter what damage they cause in their wake they will NEVER change anything or say they are sorry???</p>
